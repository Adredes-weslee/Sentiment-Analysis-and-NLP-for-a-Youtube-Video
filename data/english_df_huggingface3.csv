"※%$%&%$%##Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when print self currency and sprinkle it, such trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it. The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing scenario to most war. In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for modern nation. Electricity stops, and production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did hero side and controlled the world after the war. And got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that prevent the colonial rule. believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever. The founding of country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes Mongoloid Korean of the same kind sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. cannot perform such suicidal act. The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of nation of the United States comes from colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, believed that it was fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason. American Mason performs plot lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack ( order Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, plane shooting down case ( order Ukraine) in Malaysia. The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and phase contradicted freedom each other. If company raises profit freely, there is it, and rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if have the frames saying that do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism? The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform fixed quarrel when understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States let us you shoot missile for Japan. Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War was made to assume burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, lost on purpose. let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and share price manipulation and fraud to say and am threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold stock at profit before sudden fall obtained vast profit. pilot at .. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom Korean military unit survived to death by flame thrower. shot member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly. Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to big city of Japan and .. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to bog of the war, and they are dropped by plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God. moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming). World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war). Mount Fuji is great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in row in all parts of the world. An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. The world (Buddhists' paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024. Final note The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other kill cow pig, and to eat meat? conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because killed animal retaliates for human being, cancer occurs. The meat which ate becomes the blood, and vindictive spirit dwells in cell when blood does formation to cell. human being is cruel, and fornication, falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. thing of the world is thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It let us you compensate for human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if writhe with hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. let vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war because. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as pilot light. Are all of you ready???%&%$#%$?.......................",0,0.5804886817932129

And then if you are like me you think that you got to leave and go focus on you. Go get centred with you. Or if not that you just need more love. Sometimes its not love. Sometimes its just an environmental problem. And love can make you blind and think that love is the issue and or solution. Do yourself favour and do not stop focusing on you. In and or out of relationship. Of any kind. You just might save your life. #anemia #anemicproblems. Its not broken heart syndrome. You just need more iron. ""She is not dead but sleepth. Give her meat"" -- Jesus, tHB. Eat steak. Eat some deep leafy greens. You may not even be depressed. That sadness can just be low iron. You might not even be stressed. That tiredness can and exhaustion can just be due to low iron. Especially if you have been focusing on your self care this whole time. You might not even have anxiety. Especially if you take time to get right and focus on your emotions. Those chest palpitations and randoms sporadic out of the blue rapid heart beats and stomach pains that shoot within your gut. Your not in fear. You Are not in danger. You Are in complete and calming environment. That calms you and helps you to remain calm. It might not even be fear or aniexty. It might just be low iron which is needed for food absorbstion in the gut. #braingutbiome. Maybe your spiritual walk is great. And slowly but surely you let everything go. Until it was just you. To check what is wrong with your life. All your passions, interst and hobbies because your health and good quality of life was more important. Maybe you could handle your life but still needed to make sure that you could handle you in your life as person. Sometimes its not you. Sometimes its the system. Studying to be doctor and did not learn about it (Anemia). Get blood test. It can also help detect some breast cancers too. Early research stages. Either way For anemia paid attention in health classes did not learn it. Thought was ""frequent flyer"" was in the ER' so often. Doctors did not detect it. So many different places they said was find. You ever do your HS math homework in the ER? ... fun. Went right in to my doctor first month in! He said it was fine. PLEASE STOP NORMALIZING HEAVY PERIOD PAINS AS NORMAL. THERE NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT HEAVY PAINS. And normal has range. Even for pain. There is range. When you normalize everything you negate actual non normal and you should check on this more experiences. Would could lead people to start to think that they are crazy. When really they are not crazy. The system is not lazy. Its just some people have not yet finished doing there jobs. There is still so much out there to discover, uncover. So for anyone who feels crazy, you may not be crazy. Check your environment. Your relationships, passions, interests, hobbies, etc. It was hard journey but discovered stuff about myself. It should not have had to take that long. There should be other healthier ways for catalyst for journey of self discovery. As well finding out diagnosis. Why did not they teach this? What else then have we been missing? We need to ventilate stories like this? How many other people may think that they are crazy when it could not be them. It could just be discover that has not been so widely known and or accepted yet. Anemia is not new. But why do not people make those correlation yet. When it comes to the biology of the body. You need to have seperate areas. But then you have to be able to correlate to the whole body. Inter Independence with your body also. Overall certain part and then overall and certain parts as well. Some things are connected obviously because it is the human body. And we should treat it as such as well. When you let your brain think of it like this in terms of biology. And then in other areas, like business, science, arts, etc. Then how many other discoveries solutions can also be made. #SO IS #games #connection #connectivetissue. James 2:20. Translate Your outlets. And see just what gOD can show you. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Are you trying to leave the relationship? To prove that it is not the relationship? Are you trying to check in with yourself to prove that the problem is not yourself? Are you trying to get centred with you, to allow yourself to get ready to level up? Are you trying to have some proper alone time to get right with gOD? Are you trying to be alone safely so that you can recharge? Are you just trying to take care of yourself? People who can take care of themselves know that something is off, when they are having some problems and or difficulties doing for themselves what they usually can do for by themselves? Sometimes its pride. Sometimes its Ego. Other times its Ego and Pride. Other times that is your internal clock sounding the alarm! That something is off. Something is really off. Know yourself. So that if the world says that you are good. You will know if their right or not. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 “To Thine Own Self Be True” — Shakespeares, Hamlet. Sometimes its not you. Sometimes, its the system. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.5262559652328491

"The Rapture For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger series of other subsequent events. Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And, even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life. call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live. Deuteronomy 30:19 . WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR?",1,0.7459699511528015

"Do you consider yourself to be good person? Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of ""good."" The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God' Law . . . With tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following: 1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?) 2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made god in your mind that you are more comfortable with, god to suit yourself?) 3. You shall not take God' name in vain. (Have you ever used God' holy Name as cuss word?) 4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. 5. Honor your father and mother. 6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder). 7. You shall not commit adultery. (""Whoever looks upon woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart"" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage). 8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant). 9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions). 10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?) The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments? Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be corrupt Judge if He turned blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments? The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you are not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God' Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live. God Himself made way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn' it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves? How can we then, live ""good"" life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? ' sure you wouldn'. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, "" should enter Heaven because have done good - have earned my way in."" Imagine if you wanted to give me brand new (very expensive) car, but said, "" can' take it! feel embarrassed receiving such gift . . . here' 10 cents for it."" ' sure you would be very insulted by such pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if pay for it, it is no longer gift, it' purchase . . . it' mine by right. When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of ""self-righteousness,"" which is terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, ""For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."" You cannot earn gift. When Jesus said to ""believe"" on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust parachute to save you when you jump from plane. You don' merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don' ""jump"" without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn' want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you. Pray something like this: ""Dear God, today turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'"" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name pray. Amen.""",1,0.5729186534881592

"Don' really see why people hated this song...to me it shows how at that age in your life when you through break up you think you are world is over not really knowing love but you know the feeling of being very infatuated. If it was his voice think some people just over dramatic, yes it was soft but most kids at age sound like that or even softer i do not know . Not gone lie coming back to it it sounds like kids bop...but real good kids bop 👏 😆 🤣 back in the day sang this so many times lol. want to hear him sing this over now though in acoustic or remixed with now mature view on heart break story. It would still sound good can just imagine hearing him sing it slower maybe less baby baby baby but it would still sound good",1,0.7668260931968689

"※Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when print self currency and sprinkle it, such trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it. The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing scenario to most war. In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for modern nation. Electricity stops, and production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did hero side and controlled the world after the war. And got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that prevent the colonial rule. believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever. The founding of country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes Mongoloid Korean of the same kind sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. cannot perform such suicidal act. The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of nation of the United States comes from colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, believed that it was fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason. American Mason performs plot lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack ( order Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, plane shooting down case ( order Ukraine) in Malaysia. The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and phase contradicted freedom each other. If company raises profit freely, there is it, and rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if have the frames saying that do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism? The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform fixed quarrel when understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States let us you shoot missile for Japan. Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War was made to assume burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, lost on purpose. let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and share price manipulation and fraud to say and am threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold stock at profit before sudden fall obtained vast profit. pilot at .. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom Korean military unit survived to death by flame thrower. shot member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly. Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to big city of Japan and .. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to bog of the war, and they are dropped by plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God. moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming). World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war). Mount Fuji is great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in row in all parts of the world. An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. The world (Buddhists' paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024. Final note The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other kill cow pig, and to eat meat? conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because killed animal retaliates for human being, cancer occurs. The meat which ate becomes the blood, and vindictive spirit dwells in cell when blood does formation to cell. human being is cruel, and fornication, falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. thing of the world is thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It let us you compensate for human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if writhe with hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. let vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war because. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as pilot light. Are all of you ready?",0,0.691452145576477

THIS SONG IS SO GOOD after 12 year,1,0.9962522387504578
"Can Christian Fall Away & Return to God? Question from Site Viewer Initially, joined Baptist church, and believed to accept Jesus in seventh grade and was baptized. For couple years was really involved. But then fell away. prayed at times and felt could live in worldly fashion–greedy for money, hungry for lust, etc.–then just ask for forgiveness and be safe. grew in anger and hostility to religion. really fell away and turned and said things now regret. am now 29. Recently, all of sudden have had this burning and overwhelming desire to read the Bible and search for meaning. have become hardened over time, and do struggle with temptations and wrongful thoughts. But now the Gospel is hitting me and know have erred. am deeply troubled however by Hebrews 6:4-6 and 2 Peter 2:20-22 and Hebrews 10:26. Is it not possible for someone to return to repentance after having denied God earlier? Can person who goes through the motions, then goes his own way, come to repentance? Or have crossed point of no return? Is it impossible to truly follow Jesus Christ again and be saved as these verses seem to indicate? Or is falling away consistent state that can be broken? 1 Timothy 1:13 is troubling as well. What if one willfully sins after having knowledge? Can Christian fall away and ever receive God’ mercy again? am really struggling with these sorts of chapters dealing with apostasy. just feel like am lost. Please help! Tim’ Answer First, would commend to you the article Does God Want Me Back, where we address your question as it relates to Hebrews 6:4-6 and Hebrews 10:26. God is the God Jesus told us about in Luke 15. He always welcomes the sinner back. No matter how badly His people have sinned, His desire is their return. If you fall away and return, the Father will welcome you with open arms. If you have trouble believing this, challenge you sometime to begin with Isaiah and read through all of the prophets and mark how badly they had sinned and how many times God continued to call them to repent. And even when they ultimately did not repent, and God brought judgment, God promised to go with them into captivity and to bring them back. As He says in Ezekiel 18, He has no pleasure in the death of those who fall away, but rather wants them to repent. He is the Father who has more joy over one sinner who repents than over 99 sheep who need no repentance. From Abraham to Peter, we have long history of God’ people falling away and the Father welcoming them back when they turn to Him. So, can say with confidence that even if you fall away, if you seek God, you will find Him and in your finding your heart will be delighted. You ask about 2 Peter 2:20-22. The character of false teachers is that they have no desire to repent. They desire the pigpen, the vomit. The point is that they never knew Christ, but were always pigs and dogs. They were never sheep. They did not fall away. The 2 Peter passage does not speak to the issue of those who desire to repent. For such people, God’ arms are always open. He delights in our return. Is this not the entire point of the parable of the prodigal son? And if he did not delight in our return, there would not be person on earth that would have any hope. While you may have fallen away like the prodigal son and others may be like the elder son, both needed to have father who was willing to forgive them. Each of us have sinned. We may think some sins are big and some are small, but the point is that we all have sinned and fallen short of God’ glory. And, we all have sinned willfully. Those who think otherwise are deceiving themselves. If the Father did not forgive our sins, none of us would have any hope. But His great desire is to have His creation be in fellowship with Him. You ask about 1 Timothy 1:13, where Paul found mercy because he sinned ignorantly in unbelief. That passage is an interesting passage. Translated woodenly, the passage reads “because being ignorant did [it] in unbelief.” The focus is that the mercy was extended, not because of ignorance, but because of unbelief. Mercy is always needed for unbelief. It is not needed for belief. Mercy did not come because of ignorance, but because of unbelief. As .. Robertson points out in his tome Grammar of the New Testament, the participle “being ignorant” carries “manner” meaning rather than “causal” meaning. Stated in another way, Paul lived and did all of these things in the state of unbelief, while he was ignorant. God’ mercy was extended because of Paul’ unbelief, not because of Paul’ ignorance. Paul’ ignorance was an accompanying manner or characteristic of his unbelief, but it was not the reason for the mercy. The mercy came because of the unbelief, which is why we all need mercy. The context also draws us to this reading. In 1 Timothy 1:15, Paul states that he was the chief of sinners. There are no sinners greater than Paul was. God is not saying, and Paul is not saying, that there are certain sinners who act ignorantly and on these God will have mercy but for the greater sinners who act deliberately God will not have mercy. Such reading would do violence to the text. How can Paul be the worst of sinners if he only sinned ignorantly while others sin intentionally? This makes no sense. And if Paul is making distinction between willful and ignorant sins, then how could God ever show all longsuffering to Paul as pattern for the rest of us? None of the rest of us can claim that we have never sinned willfully. The passage should not be read to state that God used Paul as this great example to us but actually there is no hope for the rest of us because Paul’ example does not fit us. Such would turn the passage on its head. Moreover, all of Scripture is filled with examples of intentional sins. Abraham asked Sarah to lie for him; David murdered Uriah; Manasseh did more evil than all the kings before him; Peter denied Christ, the prodigal son left his family for an intentional life of sin . . . If we take the position that intentional sins are not forgiven, then are we consigning Abraham, David, Manasseh, and Peter to hell? Did not all these believers fall away? Did Jesus misspeak when He told about the reception of the prodigal son? read 1 Timothy 1:13 as saying that God extended mercy precisely because of the need for mercy in Paul. Paul was acting in unbelief and was ignorant, and needed mercy. That is the condition of us all before we come to Christ (see Ephesians 4:18). We are ignorant and are in unbelief. In any event, Paul in 1 Timothy 1:13 is talking about his conversion to Christ. He is not talking about the forgiveness of sins and restoration of fellowship for believers. To those who are believers and err, Paul admonishes the church to restore such one in the spirit of gentleness (Galatians 6:1). There is forgiveness with God. It is His nature and delight to forgive, restore, and renew hearts. My encouragement to you is to seek God. have long thought that even if Scripture said there was no hope, the proper response of us all would be to petition heaven and seek to serve God, understanding like the Ninevites of old that perhaps God will change His mind (Jonah 3:7-9; see also David in 2 Samuel 12:22). God may be gracious even as He was to Israel after He told them they had gone too far and He was through with them (Judges 10:13, 16; 11:32). But we do not face such situation. Rather, we have God who pleads with us to return to Him. As Isaiah 55:6-7 so eloquently states: Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord and He will have mercy on him and to our God for He will abundantly pardon. If you will spend your lifetime seeking and serving God in mercy, truth, and love, you will come to the end of life happy man. You will be surprised how through the years your life is transformed into the image of His Son, Jesus. Instead of hatred, there will be love; instead of irritation, there will be longsuffering. Instead of sadness, there will be joy. Instead of anxiety, there will be peace. Instead of being controlled by one’ emotions, there will be self-control so that the emotions serve you and do not imprison you. You will experience some of heaven on this earth, as you experience the Holy Spirit in the life of following Christ. And though it may take some time to reform your mind to get rid of the things you have placed in there, through memorization of the Word, prayer, and focus, you can win that battle and look back with thanksgiving and gratitude to God for mind, heart, and life that feels clean and pure. May the Lord Jesus be the brother besides you, the companion within you, and the joy before you.",0,0.5334179997444153

However, making that primary pursuit in life is sinful. “People who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction” (1 Timothy 6:9, NLT). “Do not toil to acquire wealth” (Proverbs 23:4, ESV). The world would have us believe that the only way to become rich and famous is to set goals and pursue them doggedly. The Bible paints different picture. Consider three biblical figures whose examples speak to this issue: 1. First and foremost is Jesus. When tempted by Satan, He intentionally rejected the opportunities to become rich and famous (Matthew 4:1–11). Jesus devoted Himself to the tasks God gave Him (John 5:19). We are compelled to take the attitude of Jesus, “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing. . . . He humbled himself” (Philippians 2:5–8).What was the result of Jesus’ humbling Himself? “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name” (verse 9). 2. Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. As slave, he had no ambitions to be rich and famous. He only did the work that was put before him. In Potiphar’ house, Joseph’ faithfulness resulted in his being put in charge of everything. Later, in jail, he helped his fellow prisoners, earning trust that ultimately led to his being put in charge of all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. In short, Joseph focused on what God wanted him doing, and as result he became one of the most powerful and famous men in the world (see Genesis 37—41). 3. He was not wealthy, but the apostle Paul was perhaps the most famous Christian ever to live. How did his fame become worldwide and timeless? He simply did what God put him on earth to do: make disciples. He certainly had claim to worldly fame, describing some of his accomplishments in Philippians 3:4–6. Yet what did he think about these pursuits that would have warranted fame? “Whatever were gains to me now consider loss for the sake of Christ” (verse 7). Paul’ ambition was never to become famous or gather the accolades of men. His burning ambition was to do God’ work and glorify Christ. That was his higher calling. In Matthew 6:10–20, Jesus teaches us not store up treasures on earth, but in heaven. Then He says, “You cannot serve both God and money” (verse 24). And “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things [the basic necessities of life] will be given to you as well” (verse 33). That is, stop trying to be rich and famous, and instead simply seek after God, living out His purposes for your life. If God wants earthly riches to come your way, they will. For those whose ambition is to be rich, the Bible has many cautions. Jesus said that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:24). Material wealth has way of taking our eyes off of what’ important and eternal. Jesus’ parable of the rich fool in Luke 12:16–21 teaches that it is foolish to store up earthly things and take no thought of heavenly things. As for pursuing fame, the Bible is equally cautioning: “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled” (Matthew 23:12). Paul says that “ person with changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people” (Romans 2:29, NLT). James asks, “Don’ you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (James 4:4). Those who are rich and famous often struggle to obey basic biblical commands such as “Be content with what you have” (Hebrews 13:5) and “Do not be proud, but enjoy the company of the lowly. Do not be conceited” (Romans 12:16, BSB) and “Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you” (James 5:1). To be clear, it’ not wrong to have wealth. It’ the love of money that is root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). But those with wealth should understand where the wealth comes from (God), the purpose for having it (to further God’ work), and it’ transitory nature (see Proverbs 23:5). Ecclesiastes 2:24 notes, “ person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil.” But the same passage clarifies the Source of our blessings: “This too, see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?” (verses 24–25). We should not make fame and fortune primary pursuit in life. Rather, we should make glorifying God our primary goal. We love Jesus and obey Him (John 14:15). We follow Jesus, which means we deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow wherever He leads (Mark 8:34). Jesus blesses the meek (Matthew 5:5); being rich and famous is not usually His plan for His children in this world.",0,0.5769713521003723

"happy birthday🎂to the king, to the savior of billion lives, to the most beautiful, kind, and talented man on earth.💜 #JustinBieber wish you the best on your birthday my king. if we tryna go back to the timestamp when an angel was sent from heaven, it was in 1st march, 1994, London Ontario Canada' Jude' Hospital' second floor' 126 number room, in 12:56 minutes 58 seconds:)♡ first time got to know Justin was in 2018 with his Boyfriend song we all know how handsome he looked on the mv how easy it was for every girls to crush on him😌 i am so proud of you Justin, you deserve all the achievements that you have today. ♡Justin Bieber is the most subscribed solo artist on YouTube. ♡Justin Bieber is the only singer whose YouTube videos' views are more than 20billion. ♡Justin Bieber is the first and only artist who has 5 songs with 1billion+2billion+3billion views in his channel. ♡Justin Bieber is the artist who got world famous in only 14 years old. ♡Justin Bieber is the most followed singer on whole social media platforms. ♡Justin Bieber is the prince of pop, new king of pop, current king of pop. Last but not the least, Justin Bieber is the 2nd most awarded male artist with 617+ awards meanwhile Michael Jackson is the first one with 1k awards. Crazy to think how 28 years old guy has become next MJ with talent.❣😚 Justin Bieber' mom Pattie Mallette was aborted to kill her son by her husband (Justin' dad) Jeremy Bieber. fortunately she never did it. After all the dangerous situations she went through, finally gave birth to her adorable son 28 years ago today. today, that baby is none other than 4.7billion Beliebers' diamond Justin Bieber.<33 after Justin got much fame, his cruel dad really came back to them. Crazy to think Justin made sure to forgive that cruel dad who tried to kill him! and still he makes sure to say that he has beautiful mother and beautiful father. let' fall in love with the mercifulness of Justin Bieber. always💜 one of my favourite inspirations Gautam Buddha one day saw in the streets that person was hurting duck physically. the duck was so hurt and was bleeding. soft hearted Gautam Buddha then also hurt himself by piercing the arrows on his hands to feel the duck' pain. just like that, after so many years in 2018, kind of same thing was done by Justin Bieber. while doing morning walk, Justin saw some homeless people were lying down in the streets. they had no place to live. they had stone instead of pillows to sleep on. kind hearted Justin Bieber felt nothing to go to them and lied down beside them with stone. just to feel them. yeah he did, he literally knows the pain for not having anything because he also went through that moment in his childhood. crazy to think the boy who incomes 285 million dollars in year is lying down in streets with stone beside homeless people. yes! because he knows, an artist' job isn' only singing and dancing and entertaining audience but also many other unique duties. how not to love such angel?♡ not perfect Justin Bieber is. he had mistakes. you won' see any other celebrity to apologise this much for making some little mistakes. he' so sincere. can literally make thousands of paragraphs by writing all the beautiful sides of Justin Bieber but restricting my love for him in facebook status is so impossible. Justin was silent for 4 straight years. his mistakes, weakness, imperfections everything he had put behind the back of him. after making ownself great again and being confident, he came back with masterpiece album ""Changes"" where he has shown off his changes throughout the years. that album placed in 200 hot billboard. it was his being no1 for the 7th time. many people sing songs. but how many people sing those songs which even change people' lives? Justin' lyrics, words, speeches, are the best thing that can light up your mood when you are down. he has unlimited awards. his voice is heart warming. his eyes are full of dreams. his heart is full of love. his records are uncountable. can' even remember all right now. Happiest 28th birthday, Justin Bieber. you inspire us like nobody else. you have created irreplaceable level blast since you have entered the industry. legend. real king. thankyou for saving my life,thankyou for existing. your existence= full of talent, full of kindness, full of cuteness♡ the ending will be with an iconic speech of Justin Bieber~ ""Everytime we wake up is another blessing. Follow your dreams, never let anything, anyone chase you. Never say Never"" ❤",1,0.7231067419052124

"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:15) The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. (Psalms 14:1-4)",0,0.9802539348602295

"remember wonderful moment: You appeared before me, Like fleeting vision, Like genius of pure beauty. In the languor of hopeless sadness, In the anxieties of noisy bustle, gentle voice sounded to me for long time And dreamed of cute features. Years passed. Storms are rebellious gust Dispelled the old dreams, And forgot your gentle voice, Your heavenly features. In the wilderness, in the darkness of imprisonment My days dragged on quietly Without divinity, without inspiration, Without tears, without life, without love. The soul has awakened: And here you are again, Like fleeting vision, Like genius of pure beauty. And the heart beats in ecstasy, And for him they were resurrected again Both divinity and inspiration, And life, and tears, and love.",1,0.9640721082687378

Also there was no more sea. 2 Then , John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as bride adorned for her husband. 3 And heard loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥",1,0.9265855550765991

"remember seeing this on tv as kid. Initial thoughts, cute. The bullying of JB at the time, for fricking while, was disgraceful. Those people hope were ashamed of themselves & improved upon their attitudes. Doesn’ even matter if his image or music had gotten better or if he had not had more music made after. Bullying like that isn’ good especially to kid/teen/young adult. was not one of those people, to say anything mean/unfair about him, thank goodness, and full honesty didn’ see reasons for it. Biever - didn’ make sense. Where’ the bieverness that was just dumb spin on his name. His hair was cool, that was the skater boy anime fashion look. And the song was catchy and sweet. Many kids were like that in those days in their early teens. Bullying like that on such huge scale wasn’ funny. He’ strong for sticking with his passions & getting past that and continuing to make music and be in his videos even. Bcoz lot of people & media weren’ even deserving of them you know. 👏 💖",1,0.7394805550575256

"It is destined for people to die once, and after this comes judgment Hebrews 9:27 NASB But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 NASB For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:16 NASB Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 NASB Jesus answered, Truly, truly, say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 NASB For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons and daughters of God. Romans 8:14 NASB The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 NASB Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever person sows, this he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 NASB For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins, Hebrews 10:26 NASB Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it. Matthew 7:13-14 NASB THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND WHICH HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HUMAN HEART, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM. 1 Corinthians 2:9 NASB This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.

"This is not just song but time machine for me to look back at my childhood. This shall always have special in my heart. : How were the 2010s like? : The era when very young Justin Bieber had just started. 💗 The 90s kids were living the time of their life. They were the new adults who were seeing the best of both worlds. They were the ones who were making memories and inspiring our generation. 😌 The world was better place... And somewhere silently we 2000s kids were enjoying our childhood too; growing up in that era listening to these wholesome songs and discussing about them in our schools. Today 11 years later, am not that 8 year old kid anymore... 🤧 Never ever in my worst of dreams did ever think, the world would be suffering like this. My heart aches on seeing how our generation is growing up in these difficult pandemic times, unable to even go outside and see the world. 🥺 was born in November 2002 and honestly wish was born 10 years back... just to have witnessed the best of times with my whole consciousness as teen/adult and not as kid. Hoping for the best for everybody! 🧡",0,0.6941987872123718

"The Christian God is the True God and am going to prove it right now: God has Law called the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). These Laws include do not lie, do not steal, don’ put others gods before Him (Exodus 20) Have you ever broken any of these Laws? Have you ever told lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever lusted after someone? If we really went over God’ Laws in the Bible, every single one of them, it can really expose how much of sinner we truly are and because we have all committed these acts our punishment is Hell because God’ standard is perfection. Our good works cannot get us into Heaven. That’ like you steal soda from the store but you tell the judge, “hey judge give to the orphanage, do community service.” The judge will not care about what you did. You stole something that was not yours so therefore the Judge is going to find you guilty. God is the same way. But, this Judge is loving Judge who does not want to sentence you for your crimes. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to come and take the punishment for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and accept jesus Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved from the sentence. Jesus loves you and is not willing that any should perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16) God bless",1,0.8119004964828491

"'know, like, love or hate this song? It came out almost twelve years ago. really need to stop scouring the Internet for excuses to feel old, but damn if this isn' reason to feel so. wasn' even ten when this song came out. Now ' pushing twenty. All had to worry about when this song was new was if the school cafeteria happened to be serving stuffed crust pizza that day. We have gone from counting its dislikes to not being able to tell at all. But, well... used to hate this song as kid on account of it being too childish and girly to my young ears (despite being too childish to understand what the words even meant). Now have passing appreciation for it and the time period it represented, and ' currently up to my ears in MLP merch (because mentioned offhandedly that ' never watched the show but thought it was animated well and had good morals, and my youngest female cousin must be psychic, and forced enough merch on me to finally cave in and watch it. don' necessarily consider the show girly, more girl-oriented, but, well, it was made with girls in mind).

"3:06 Ohh so maybe he sold his soul. To get the soul stone. 3:22 In order to better get to his love. When she needed help the most. 2:18 Tamar was drowning. 2:33 He needed to get through the fog!!! Pass the fog sometimes is the cliff dive. 2:54 Tamar was drowning. Chained to the problems that she may have felt chained to the bottom under the water. The resistance your triggers, your warning signals, your gut instinct to try and keep you safe. But when love is drowning and potentially dying. Well... You will do almost anything for the ones that you love. gOD will find way for his anointed. aLWAYS. believe that. You may have met the good Samaritan of the flesh. But what about the good Samaritan of the spirit?? How you survive the pandemic is between you and gOD. Same with how you may have tried to held from your problems that may have happened in gOD' time. Address the problem not just how people solved the problem. Things spread good and bad, choose wisely. What about Tamar and how she was choosing to solve her problem. John 8! You cannot tell me that Tamar was not the adulteress. The lady with man men but no husbands. The lady at the well. Did jESUS not give her pure water. It was not to address then yet the Men adn why they cheated. But to address the problem. On why she only went after marriage men. You had to be unpacked to married back then. What then did she at least ask before she was fully violated. Violated in more ways then one. ""Let he without sin cast the first stone"" -- Jesus. The debater. Fighting on the lowly' defence.

"Invading People Privacy to see if they are trust worthy. Vetting: There' Got To be better way! Maybe kING dAVID was applying his critical and strategic thinking from life of war on the war zone with gOD while still in gOD anointed; to his family. But that being said when it comes to family you John 8 ""Let every man go unto his own home"" __ THB. But also ""grow on your own soil"" -- THB yes. But blood is thicker then water. And so water will help you to see better. Talking about what is happening with other peoples families. Is how you can not hide the saying of the dark from the youth. Health and safety, the power of habit book inspo. How you can come up with you rules for you and yours when it comes to family due to because fo other peoples family. But also to protect your own. And help guide other should they be ready to branch out to other peoples families and start there own families. But before that for when they are to hang out with friends and friends of the family. Not just them but also there family' family. The art of war. Translated to the Art of War: Family Addition. But that requires patience. And patience requires communication, other wise your more at risk to potentially man down, the wrong person. Especially if you are trying to learn where you are assailants assailant had learnt it from. Maybe your assailant was child. And so any and all areas that you are assailant learnt it from was wrong. Maybe that is how you uncover bigger problem. And trying to find truth after could be how you uncover massive cover up! ""Get to the root of what you don' yet fully understand"" -- THB. But what happens what that root is very deep and just keeps going and going. See from Reading The Holy Bible we know that there was Jonadab but the other people in The Holy Bible did not know. But maybe from King Davids training and experience in the war he could have figure as much. Maybe King David was just trying to smoke him out. Breath of Life Florence and the machine. That requires patience as well which requires open communication. But when you are not sure who to trust especially in your family. ""You run the risk of blessing curse and //or cursing blessing"" -- THB. Yes faith but at the same time don' be dumb. ""Do not embrace ignorance"" -- THB. Working and dealing with another family is how you can work while you wait. Have open communication. But how do you start to build trust when there might just be snake all up in that grass. You could be telling them your warnings. You educating. 8 ball. Protect the children. In this family we do not take kill shots. Jonadab' law. Because dead man can' pay and also dead man can' day who set them up. Ever wonder why scar had such big scar on his face. That was Jonadab and//or that was maybe even the snake. Or the frog or pinnochino or the liar. How do you uncover fake rose in the garden, that there is soil underneath the sidewalks, let it all grow out! That someone is lying! Honest and direct communication! You ever play broken telephone how does the game end! Let some lies pile up and then address it at dinner time. That Is when Tamar' brother killed her brother -- Caine and Abel -- but with good fulfilment trying to protect loved one. Hence why Jesus said ""For it is not the letter of the law, but the fulfilment"" -- THB when debating with the Pharises. Why he was outside of the church with the lowly. Where was Tamar when it was all said and done. Covered in Ashes, in grief with little to no color clothing. Where was Tamar' brother after he killed to protect his sister? Outside of the house of King David sin exile. Not everyone runaway some are kicked out. Jesus the ""lowly there is wisdom"" -- THB. aNd so also the doctor for the lowly, ""The whole need not doctor"" -- THB. For which there was originally shepherd who went back for his lost sheep. That being said how did Jesus handle the dinner after relaunched and recreate to smoke out Jonadab. To smoke out Judas. Dinner with direct and honest communication! In other words and intervention. Now tAMAR was not on the outskirts with the brother who killed her brother. And she knew that she had brother of the clothes friend within the church; sent to her by gOD. Who she could have also known outside of the church. But she also had lover outside of the church. Sent to her by gOD. who she maybe did not know was of the cloth. Tamar lover sent by gOD could have very well fxxked up some shit with gOD in hurry to make things right and or help tAMAR walking around in ashes outside of the church. Do you ever why lUCIFER crossed the line? The Police line? Why does anyone do anything?? LOVE !!!!!! ""If its always open then its no longer clean"" -- THB. One opened box stacked on bunch of other sealed ones. He could not do it on his own and so hE got tAMARs brother of the cloth from inside the church; to help out with// when it comes to help. tAMAR stood on her truth and her righteousness. And maybe that is why gOD sent jESUS to create the church outside of the church. To help heal the problems of what is going on inside the church. Someoen needs to do undercover boss. But someone needs to still work deep within the shop. Someone else needs to still run lead the shop. The art of war and th art of war family addition. Both run on your own soil. But there just run little different. Family edition is at times of peace. 1984. What kind of peace are you thinking. Are you fighting for peace? And or are you fighting for pieces. Peace with need then some healthy and safe ventilation if they are to lay down in green pastures. ADN not burn the soil to fight and address the truth. Frozen 2. Kept truth and righteousness seperate. You have have peace on the axis. Righteousness little bit and lot of it can have peace. Truth, truth for truth and truth for solution can have peace. First. Until then let it be like the Bahamian sea touches the ocean. Where Truth and righteousness may dance, meet, but they do not merge. If you want to go to the ocean you plan for it. Same with times of peace. Hence why Jesus has both keys. ""Count the cost less you be laughed to scorn"" -- Judas with his ""False balance is an abomination unto the lORD thy gOD"" -- THB. Math Algebra. What happens when gOD has an abomination but your not trying to be failed jOB? Fail in the valley! cHRIST street living!!!! That Is on the truth side of shit!! Chirstian Philosophy? ""Rejoice in the truth and not the choas"" -- THB at 3. Ventilation at 7. And truth for solution at the river with the net at 11. But you have got to go the distance. DOn' skip steps. 1st string. Completiong brings you to 2nd string. Completion brings you to 3rd string. Sometimes its all of them. But really Tides and harvest. ""Leave the first to gOD"" -- THB and ""Save half for harvest"" -- THB. And so as such deal with the truth, the fruits of your labour, the grim reaper, at harvest. After you have completed the full circle of one. You grow and move forward to two. If there are whole and or false balance. Well that is what said. And also seventh day of rest. Let gOD and aBEL do its thing. You know aBEL works different. But still anointed. Probably making the letter for all that is fulfilment to visually see in the flesh how Christianity is really doing. Look at America and tell me ' wrong. Christianity needs some ventilation. How you handle aMERICA is how you handle gODs kingdom. Its not just the land of the soulless from carbon monoxide poisoning due to lack of healthy adn safe space for ventilation. Its also Judas balancing out ""Knowledge for unerstanding"" -- THB. Left side for right side. Letter for fulfilment. You need the vision to see. And to think for solution to move forward. That why my Dad brought me into society. Which community is best for you. And what you can see? And what you can do? Hence why the gOOD sAMARITHAN lives within the village. Will ride or die and ressurect best from inside the village. And then Caine can see and speak on this. But needs great place to catch it. See how its made. ""Be Bold Like Lion"" -- THB. Cool running. Book end what has been learnt. Righteousness making better system. And then sowing new seeds. Uprooting the corrupt ones. have not gotten to the other side of the soil; fully though yet. gOD did not explain fulfilment before exiling kING dAVID. And kING dAVID did not explain his vetting art of war family edition. And so his son killed his other son who assaulted their sister. Either way lack of communication. High Risk that the war was rushed. The battles were won. The wars potentially lost. Communication is key. Good Communication is key!!! You just need to know who and how to trust. You do not want to love with bruised and or broken heart. Especially if you can help it. ANd nobody wants to feel dismissed, mistrusted and //nor disrespected. Everyone wants to feel honored, validated, respected, with something, trusted. Work while you wait. Work where you can. Pockets full of sunshine. BBTM they still help. My head. That Is all I Have got for now. Best, . In Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.5895364284515381
"0:45 Justin Bieber has been Drew from Feburary 2010! -- Just in Time. 2:03 Ohhhh do you ever stop to think that maybe the Ash falling down on lUCIFER in heLL is maybe that from tAMAR' heart. Why did the aNGEL really truly fall and//or get casted out??? Lil Nas ' Montero? Fallen to stripper pole? kING dAVID' daughter why did she use the ashes?? 2:19???Chains Music Video by Nick Jonas??Follow me into Christian Philosophy would you. For the church outside of the church? Tamar Maybe???? Maybe he is just trying to help his love? Maybe it was just her brother that was shooter for her in the house. The one who murder her brother the one who assaulted. Maybe Tamar also really but truly had lover in the church. One who courted her. Who she was saving herself for marriage for. Who she really truly loved. Who like her was also gOD fearing. Maybe aDAM ate the aPPLE to try and understand his lover. To try adn see if hE too could also help her. When your rib hurts you hurt too!! To be clear am not saying that Tamar was in love with her brother. Either of them. She had gOD first. She then had herself, her family and then the church and lover that she had in the church. Maybe that is where she met and//or also knew lUCIFER. Remember hE was cast out, but then why was he cast out. Maybe that was her brother covered up under the cloth. Sometime you have your family that you are born into (Blood of the flesh) . Other times you have the family that gOD choses for you (Blood of Jesus -- Blood of the Spirit: Follow Sheep in Christianity ). And then you have the family that gOD also chose for you. Same thing. (Blood of Jesus -- Blood of the Spirit: Follow Sheep in Christianity ).But romantic relationship sent to you and//or sent for you by gOD. You know. Serendipity for some. Others only met by the grace of gOD. So maybe tAMAR had friend in the church. brother of gOD' hOLY sPIRIT that she was friends with inside the world but also knew inside the church. Adn then she had her own lover covered under the sent to her by gOD. Like Bathesha -- maybe that is who is her mOTHER. aLL of kING dAVID' children, wives, concubines, we don' truly know what happened to bATHSHEBA. Hence why kING dAVID could have been so eager to find out what truly happened to tAMAR. Because you will be loved where you have not yet healed. Second chance at fate. Redemption. second chance into gOD' good graces. Jesus' Bridesgroom: Don' sleep on your abilities. Maybe that why kING dAVID was so destraught when tAMAR' brother killed their other brother/the assaulter. Maybe kING dAVID was just trying to smoke out jONADAB. Find out who he truly was. Maybe that is why jUDAS has not yet come back in; to any gets. ""Knowledge for understanding"" -- THB. ""Due Diligence"" -- THB. ""Grow on your own soil""-- THB. Is just trying to understand what he did not fully get. When he was in the fields of blood and then understood the weight of what it meant for him when he betrayed jESUS. Peter may be in charge, but Judas may be working like aBEL of the second testament. Sometimes maybe offering Olive Branches. Sometimes maybe balancing out the Letter for the fulfilment. That may also be why Libra is off balanced. Fruits of the flesh to fruits of the spirit is not yet balanced within the society. Like of the flesh fruits of the spirit needs ventilation. Healthy and safe space to vent. Carbon Monoxide is silent killer. There should be place for that throughout the week and//or on sUNDAYS????Christain Philosophy for the Church outside of the Church!! For the house of the mourning and//or when you get to the rIVER???? Maybe??? 8 Ball. Best, . In Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.6460919976234436

"Jesus is Lord. God bless. He loves and Forgives. God isn' someone who waits for your downfall, but your redemption through His Son Jesus. Repent. This may seem uncalled for but just trust the Lord. Give God chance, not being religious but have relationship with God. Call out to Him and try and hear His voice in your heart, He doesn’ go against His Word, the Bible. If you reject it, ay your choice, God gives free will. Just got to say, He has plans to prosper you not to harm you. Again ain' saying be religious, but give God chance.

"Verse 1: Justin Bieber] You know you love me, know you care Just shout whenever and will be there You are my love, you are my heart And we will never, ever, ever be apart Are we an item? Girl, quit playing We are just friends, what are you saying? Said ""There’ another,"" and looked right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time, and was like...

"Nearly 120 billion people have been born and died on this planet. Thousands of kings, rulers, shieks, pharohs, presidents, popes, have all ruled, and at some point or another released their grip on the civilizations they influenced and controlled, Due to mortality, war, change in cultures, natural disasters.... Revolutions. The 120ish billion people that have preceeded us all sought the same thing. To know our purpose and place in the universe. To live fulfilled and joyous lives, free from sickness and violence. To also know, by what hand the artist painted this creation on an infinite easal calls itself. What does it want with us? Does it care about us? We do not have to just sit and accept our disposition. We have to be strong and actually fight for what we believe in. We owe it to the entire planet to be told the whole truth behind our secret curtain called the Government and CIA, FBI. Donald Trump was literally recruiting for the Space Force. What more does the public want to awknoweledge UFO' as reality. We certainly enjoy the idea of them in movies invading us and triumphantly defeating them with George Lucas sized explosion. So why should the government be allowed to use, technological marvels thousands of years beyond our own with infinite potential? Because they do not just want to govern the laws and just be the institution that ensures programs are working correctly and the money goes to where it is needed. They want to rule the world. They want to tell you what kind of life you get to live. They want us to suffer. They are the most prominent. Evident. And capable evils on this planet hands down. And if you weren' aware, They ARE doing that right this second that you read this. And noone is trying to stop them. That is problem my friends. Please share this everywhere you can",0,0.6578208208084106
