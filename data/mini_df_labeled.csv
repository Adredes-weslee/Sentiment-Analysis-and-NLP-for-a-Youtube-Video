1,"Sidhu Musewala was just ten months older than Justin Beaver but Justin Beaver' career started much earlier in 2008 and Sidhu' career started in 2017 and ended in 2022 Sidhu Musewala' on 29/5/22was shot and killed. But by rising from small village, what he achieved in five years, it is not just matter of everyone, looking at his popularity, then by 2030, everyone will come to No.1 in the whole world.Would have been favorite singer but alas it could not happen. God rest his soul"
