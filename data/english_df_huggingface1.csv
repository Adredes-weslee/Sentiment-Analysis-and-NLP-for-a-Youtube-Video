"message to every person who has not yet converted to Islam Peace be upon those who follow guidance. how is your heart? How is your life? are you happy? Or worried? Or upset? Is your heart shaken between entering Islam and remaining as you are? am addressing your heart, which has something within it that wants Islam, but is hesitant and perhaps afraid. My brother, live the beauty of Islam, the sweetness of Islam, and the mercy of Islam. Isn' it time for your heart to wake up from its negligence? Is it not time for you to return to God, Lord of the worlds, by entering Islam? Or are you tired of the path of Satan and his disbelief, look at the light within you, and leave the dark side. Take the darkness out of your heart, and enter the light that leads you to the truth. Or did you hear the word Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar in the call to prayer? Didn' you notice that God is greater than your worries, greater than everything, capable of changing the course of your life in the blink of an eye? Aslam, peace be upon you, rest and rest assured, and be happy, and your heart radiates happiness, mercy and satisfaction! My brother, God sent the Prophet Muhammad to all people, and he is the last of the messengers, so there is no prophet after him, and there is no happiness except in his religion, the religion of Islam. When was the last time you she would tears for fear of God, praying to Him to guide you to the right path? Have you forgotten God, God is one, one, there is no intermediary between you and God in the religion of Islam, so call upon Him whenever you want, for He sees you and hears you? Taste the sweetness of God' monologues in Islam; Because when you call upon Him in Islam, this is proof that you have removed from your mind the darkness that He has partner, for God has neither partner nor son, He is God the One who begets not and is not begotten, and there is no one equal to Him. invite you from my heart, which has known the sweetness of Islam and the mercy of Islam, to enter into it. ask God to open your heart to Islam, get up now, yes now, take bath and say: bear witness that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Feel these words, and you will feel comfort in your heart that you have not felt throughout your life.",1,0.9663221836090088

"BABY- DEUXIEME PARTIE (Part 2) John 3:1-21 The etymology of ‘Baby’, slang common noun term of endearment especially between lovers, is nondescript, and innocuous at best. In short, no one knows when, who, why the term first came about, who started it ( thought it would be song) and why it was. To me now think it was probably shortcut for _ love, sex, pregnancy, partnership for life – ergo marriage and children intent. We were all once babies, and even GOD became baby for us so that rebirth that transcends death could be ours.",1,0.6138291358947754

Justin Bieber is legend,1,0.9918611645698547
"If you where growing up around this time, you know how much hate he got.. and myself think about it from to time with how he got mega famous and all the name calling stuff must have been beyond tuff for him as kid but just as any person in general the hate was insane.. If know you know. JB goes down as one of the most hated in history but also one of the most famous in history. But regardless he’ goated. remember liking his music growing up, and being young boy at the time, you couldn’ even admit to liking his music.. like.. the hate was that bad. But know already mentioned this but now whenever have memory or something reminds me of Justin’ music, I Am always thinking about how the hate effected him and the fact that he was kid enduring all that too. Because when say that the hate was “insane” really mean it as he was one of the most hated ever. No exaggeration. But everyone respects him now cuz he’ an og so that’ good. But also too why people probably respect him more now is because back then, times were different. ’ not trying to go into all that here but for the ones who saw Bieber blow up, you know what ’ talking about and what mostly all of the hate centered in on. Bottom line is Justin Bieber and his song “Baby” made history for the best and the worst.",0,0.7435147762298584

"may be little kid But have been around Can hear the girls all scream Soon as our wheels touch down Junkets in Tokyo Fashion shoots in Milan Then private jet to Madison Square Garden Thirty six week long tours Ten singles on the charts So hear my message girl Because it comes from the heart Help me My parents sold me To big producer In the record industry He makes me do things That don' want to do Please call child services Or maybe SVU You got to help me My parents sold me To big producer In the music industry They took the cash and left me To the screaming masses If ' known all this ' skip those dancing classes tried to run away One time in Belarus They beat me with phone books So that wouldn' bruise just can' take no more Rich kid' bar mitzvahs Or paid sleep overs With Saudi princes Blinked ... in morse code Once at the VMAs They sprayed me with hose In pit for three days And when my sales drop off They will take me to resort And let rich business men Hunt me down for sport You got to help me My parents sold me To big producer In the music industry Oh, God please help me Please take some action This didn' work out For Michael Jackson Can someone help me Don' ignore what said They will sacrifice me To the god Baphomet",0,0.9594530463218689

"It is amazing how person’ state of mind can alter the perception of time. ’ sure it only took 4 or 5 seconds to severe the rope from the tree, but it seemed like an hour. When the rope was cut, the knot fell to the ground, while the end of the rope zipped across the rocks and over the edge of the cliff, the speed of it causing humming noise as it went. As soon as the rope was cut, let out cry. He dropped the knife and fell backward. Watching the rope fly over the edge brought the feelings in the passage back to me. got up and headed toward the truck. noticed was still laying there, wide-eyed, staring at the point the rope disappeared. called to him, which seemed to break his trance. He got up and hurried away from the tree, the cave, the nightmare. Neither of us said word all the way home. It is now 4 days after our trip to the cave. It has taken me 4 days and dozens of attempts to get this entire experience written into my journal. Every time started to write recalled the terrible feelings had and couldn’ write anymore. felt compelled to continue, so as to document the unbelievable events while all of the details were fresh in my mind. can still feel the pain. Still smell the stench. Still experience the terror. Even typing from my journal has taken hours. would like to write more, but it will have to wait. Even now, with several days between me and the event, can’ relax. can barely concentrate. That’ all for now. 5/19/01 It has been three weeks since our last visit to the cave. want to update everyone as to my condition, my plans for the cave, and the events of the past few weeks. apologize for not returning your phone calls. have been getting all of your messages, just haven’ felt up to calling back. Steve and Marc, thanks for your words of encouragement on my answering machine. know you two are sincerely concerned for me. You are awesome friends. Marc, know you stopped by the house few times, and ’ sorry never answered the door. It really helped me just knowing you dropped by. Sis, can hear the worry in your voice. ’ .. Don’ worry about me. Just take care of those nieces and nephews of mine. figure if can get this site updated can let everyone know at once about how am doing. lot has happened in the last three weeks, so will do my best to cover everything. guess should start where the last entry left off. It took several days to get the last journal entry written down. was so shaken up from the experience that could do little else but sit around and ponder what had happened. Right now am on long term medical leave from work. tried to go to work several days after the event, but my boss sent me home. couldn’ concentrate and looked terrible. ’ve even been to the doctor, but couldn’ tell him about the experience, so just told him was under lot of stress. He recommended rest and gave me prescription to help me relax. Mmmmm! Good drugs! When we left the cave was nearly in state of shock. could not think clearly and was having difficult time trying to understand what had happened. didn’ eat much nor did get any sleep. was glad had the presence of mind to write down my experience while it was fresh in my mind. As re-read what wrote feel like accurately portrayed what happened in the cave that day. wouldn’ change anything wrote. Even though it took three days to write it, when finished writing in my journal felt much better. guess it was kind of therapeutic. Unfortunately, it didn’ last. In fact, it was after then that things got really bad. and parted company after the trip and didn’ see him again until yesterday. didn’ try to reach him, and he didn’ try to get hold of me. Nor did either of us try to contact Joe. just dropped me off after the trip and spent the next several days by myself in my house. tried to eat but had no appetite. was restless, but couldn’ find anything to do to take my mind off the experience. That’ when determined that should write it down. As mentioned, that helped me think little clearer, and seemed to be little calmer, but it didn’ last. went to work the next day but was sent home. The day after that had an overwhelming feeling of anxiety sink into my soul. was depressed and confused and had no one wanted to turn to for comfort. was getting all kinds of phone calls from people but just let the answering machine take the calls. even changed the message on the machine to let everyone know was alright. continued in this miserable state, eating and sleeping whenever could manage, until week after the trip. Then things started to get strange. At first, was hearing sounds in the house that had no explanation. Footsteps. Shuffling noises. Creaking doors. You know, the typical horror movie fare. Only the sounds were not distinct. It was as though wasn’ sure heard what thought heard. would be eating or getting out of the shower, and stop, thinking heard something. But the sound would not repeat itself. In fact, if it weren’ for the fact that it happened frequently, couldn’ be sure there were noises in the first place. Either way, was scared. It was as though had been caught in spider web for the last week. Feelings of anxiety, foreboding, and tension filled my life. Then came the hallucinations. began seeing things in manner similar to the sounds was hearing. Just glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. When would turn to look, nothing. had been sleeping with the lights on in my room, but now kept all the lights in the house on from before dusk to after dawn. When started to see things on regular basis purchased gun. Got it from an ad in the paper so didn’ have to wait for permit. went to the doctor but didn’ mention the details of my life. Just told him couldn’ relax, and walked out of there with prescription. Fortunately, my wounds and injuries were pretty much healed by this time. My back still hurt little, but the prescription took care of that, too. When was on the medication felt great, but didn’ want to walk around high the rest of my life, so would only take it at the end of tough day. Unfortunately, the severity of the sightings increased, giving rise to need for the medication. The flashes in the corner of my eye continued, but then began to see shapes and shadows. They would be outside my windows, usually at night. still couldn’ make out anything solid, so it was hard to pin down what was was seeing. Soon began to close all of my drapes and blinds so could remove the possibilities of seeing something. Doing so did help in that respect, but my life was still mess. My daily routine was mechanical and empty. would sleep in as long as could, usually out of exhaustion. Then would get cleaned up and try to eat something. lost lot of weight, so tried to get as much as possible down me. Then would exercise little and nap lot. ’ only been out of the house few times in the last two weeks. The store, the doctor, the gun purchase. didn’ watch much .. because couldn’ concentrate. spent lot of time on the internet. was doing research on caves and cave myths. The only story could find was the caver folklore about the Hodag. The Hodag is supposedly creature that roams caves. Two weeks after we went into the cave, and week after began hearing things, began to have nightmares. Extremely lucid nightmares. No specific theme or recurring events. Just plain terrifying. Sometimes was in my house and someone was trying to get me. Only couldn’ run because had no legs. Other times was in vat and someone was pouring syrup-like liquid on me, filling the vat. would wake up in panic. would stay awake until exhaustion forced me to enter dreamland once again. brutal routine. It continued for several days, until it reached climax on the sixth day (yesterday). My dreams seemed so real had hard time telling if was awake or not. was beat, really drained of energy and spirit. was going from the living room to my bedroom in the early evening when looked down the hall and saw dark figure toward the end. thought it was thief and began to back up slowly. It didn’ move. As was backing up the lights flickered off and on. Every muscle was tense. stopped to stare at the figure. Just then the phone rang! It startled me so bad stumble over the chair. When got up wheeled around to look down the hall and nothing was there! grabbed my keys and left the house. felt compelled to get in the car and drive. My pulse pounded in my temples as got in and started the car. wanted to drive to Overlook point to see the city lights. didn’ know why needed to go there, but knew had to go. The closer got, the more urgent the feeling. When arrived at the point, saw something that at first startled me, but then caused me to be more relaxed than had been in long time. Joe was there! He was out of his car, standing, looking at the lights. We looked at each other. could see from the tired look on his face he had been going through the same miserable trial that had been experiencing. He could tell from the look on my face that we had shared some terrible experience. Our conversation was unbelievably brief. “You been back?” he began, even though he knew the answer. “Yes.” “We need to return.” “Tomorrow good?” asked. “Yeah, noon.” He got in his car and got into mine. hadn’ even wanted to talk to him about his experience.

She made my heart pound, skip beat when see her in the street and at school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend. She knows she got me dazing coz she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying…. [Chorus] Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine (repeat) Now ’ gone, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now ’ all gone.

"Guys, trust me, try listening to Rauf&Faik.They are Russian pop duet of Azerbaijani origins, formed by twin brothers Rauf and Faik Mirzaev Most of their songs sound amazing 👏 because their voices and music are incredible! The way they sing touches my soul, feel hypnotised whenever listening to them, and since started listening to them, became fan of Russian music, and its sad 😔 that many people don' know those talented and adorable fraternal twins. If you listen to Rauf&Faik song called childhood, is this happiness? And the rest of the songs of them Wholeheartedly, you will definitely feel amazed and become big fan of them, especially their music, and voices will touch your heart ❤️ ❤ ❤",1,0.9911854267120361

The way they sing touches my heart. am very hypnotised by their songs, and since started listening to them, became fan of Russian music. Trust me, if you listen to them wholeheartedly, you will definitely become big fan of them! And it' sad 😥 that many people don' know those talented and adorable fraternal twins.

Sound is music because life and beauty are one. The hate this song got was not right and due to ignorance. do not listen to this often but recognize that this to is beauty normally listen to old hippie music ' not super old though. But people don' really love music in this world. Only enlightened people who realize sound is music. It doesn' mean to love sound you want to hear anything but you recognize at least and give total love and credit to all artists. Even the bird in the tree in the morning.,1,0.6526802778244019

"YOU HAVE QUESTIONS? HAVE ANSWERS!!--Death and murder increasing! ...LAWS are made to protect people and increase or maintain quality of life for humans.. There is growing REBELLIOUS trend to TRASH laws, including moral ones, as mentioned in the bible. 99% of preachers don' even support ALL 10 commandments, and many don' support even any by their LAWLESS heresy. CRIME & CLERGY CONNECTION = TRICKLE DOWN IMMORALITY.. ""When people’ thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God’ law and really are not even able to obey God’ law."" ROMANS 8:7 Society will increasingly SUFFER! The barbarians are coming, the barbarians are coming...!!! The preachers lead the charge!! ""My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, will also reject you, that you shall be no PRIEST to me: seeing you have forgotten the LAW of your God, will also forget your children.” Hos 4:6 Christianity is mostly now populated by GULLIBLE , DECEIVED, FANATIC VICTIMS who have never read even the whole new testament once. They spend almost ALL of their weekly waking minutes (6720) influenced by perverted , depraved worldly culture and , if they attend church, learn bunch of ambiguous, abstract, obscure, religious lingo & cliches for teaching by inept preachers who are deceived modern, law trashing, bible warping Pharisees.

"Personally think the speaker could have defended her case bit more respectfully, but in the end she is right. The womb does show just how different men and woman are truly as humans. mean, one can get pregnant one can', one' private is hole and one' stick, one is naturally stronger and one' weaker, etc, etc. Also, even transgender people know that penis or vagina' so important to gender that you are not even considered different gender til have the surgery which still doesn' truly define transsexuals gender because it' not natural and if man loses his penis from shark attack then he' absolutely no less of man though would hate life after that, but anyways, even after surgery, having part of another beings body that was not from does not make man. For example, some people get pig organ transplants, but should we call them pig hybrid since are whatever connect to urself and if that were the case then transgenders should just identify as per man part woman since losing you are worm or black hole doesn' take away you are male or female arms, legs, stomach, chest, etc and anyone can go by whatever they want, but it should not be policy for everyone else to play these games. We have freedom of speech and it should not stop for some bull crap",0,0.7328884601593018

"always hated this music (and haircut) with passion. ' from the generation before and was raised on rock and metal. But stand with Corey Taylor that, like him or not, he really was great performer and an incredible dancer at such young age. It' too bad that they really didn' show off what he can really do as much as they should. also respect that he learned dancing from watching Michael Jackson.

"did my own experiment one time, have smaller weak chin/jawline and so started punching my jawline to try and toughen up my look and realized the blood swelled up on the chin and had bigger looking jawline .. the crazy part is for the next few hours remember have conversation with someone and they treated me so much differently.. they kept carrying on the conversation and then really listening to me when spoke. couldn' believe it. never did that again but should have got chin implant because that' what improves your appearance the most most. My social experiment confirmed what always thought which is most people want to feel better about themselves by associating themselves with more attractive people.",0,0.7593709826469421

"🧭🧭When you go to the other side, there' no turning back;⤴ you will have to give an account of everything you did😨🥺 or didn' do while you were alive. Didn' you want to avoid sin, didn' you want to accept Jesus✝ in your life? This will weigh heavily on your judgment!😵💫😵 Come to Jesus, attend an evangelical church, read the bible for you to know the commandments you have to practice. Jesus died for all of us, he did his part, he won, and he rose again on the third day. Will you come, will you do his part? He is talking to you now; tomorrow may be too late for you, he is waiting for you.🛐 Hugs!💋💛💙",1,0.7460276484489441

(Romans 6:23) Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. (Joel 2:12-13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)",1,0.7387080788612366

remember the days playing modern warfare 2 after school with the boys on Xbox 360. With the front door wide open on hot summer day with the cool air nicely blowing trough the windows and front door with baby playing at full blast. The good old days. No stress no heartbreak no problems. Now the world is the enemy. ’ so pleased that Justin as finally started been much more faithful too our Heavenly Father. really got sick of his BS and hated him at one point. But now he’ true brother grown into real man. And regenerated my upmost respect thank goodness he got himself onto the right path.

"Even if it reaches one soul it is of great joy. God Almighty has been revealed through his son Yeshua in hebrew ( Jesus ). Jesus is the final authority. He is the way the truth and the life. We are all born sinners. That Is why Jesus being perfect died on the cross for our sins. Jesus said there will come many after him saying they are the one. Do not listen to them. When it comes to other religions there is no other way to heaven but through Jesus. Jesus will also be the Judge of Mankind at the end of the Age.. His greatest commandments are as follows love the Lord thy God with all your strength mind and soul. The second love your neighbour as yourself. If you truely seek God you will find Yeshua ( Jesus ). It does not matter which country religion backround familly you are born in the best thing one person can do is turn from evil and accept him as your Lord and Saviour. God bless Jesus' message as He began His ministry: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel John 8:58 “Very truly tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, am!” Matthew 16:16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” John 11:25 Jesus said to her, “ am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die Matthew 24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.",1,0.9745073318481445

"It is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment. Hebrews 9:27 WEB For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 WEB But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 WEB For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:16 WEB Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 WEB Jesus answered, Most certainly tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’ enter into God’ Kingdom. John 3:5 WEB For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God. Romans 8:14 WEB One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’ see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 WEB Don’ be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever man sows, that he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 WEB Who will pay back to everyone according to their works: to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; but to those who are self-seeking, and don’ obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation. Romans 2:6-8 WEB For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins. Hebrews 10:26 WEB For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, And tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, And then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame. Hebrews 6:4-6 WEB Enter in by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter in by it. How the gate is narrow and the way is restricted that leads to life! There are who find it. Matthew 7:13-14 WEB But as it is written, Things which an eye didn’ see, and an ear didn’ hear, which didn’ enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9 WEB This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 WEB",1,0.667931854724884

hello people wanted to say how God is good God loves you so much that he died on the cross for you so that we could go to Heaven with him as long as we repent our sins and spread the gospel. His faithfulness doesn' stop their though he also lead the Isreal slaves out of Egypt and kept them safe and protected He is also slow to anger and even then his anger doesn' last long. am not ashamed to say that praise mighty God like him God who loves me and God who cares about me and God who comforts me and who helps me.Jesus loves you so much that he died on the cross for you so that you can have eternal life with him so please repent and spread the word of God Seek the Lord while you can find him. Call on him now while he is near.,1,0.9963256120681763

"It is absurd and makes no sense to try to have an income of $500-$5000 within 2-3days or week of investing or trading but it is possible over some time to make as much as $12000-$35000 in an interval of 6months-1year. If you think about it the other way as being easy. Trades involve risks or mistakes like any other profession in life like Amazon, eBay, FedEx, Apple American auto-shipping, Mountway auto transport, and Nexus Auto transport. These are professionals and experts who involve in the trade of production, manufacturing, and service delivery to the customers at times the product gets damaged and has to be replaced with another one by the companies. It won' be possible to ship these services or involve in the trade as an individual considering the factors in place of the kind of trade you want to make. In time-investing professions like Engineering, and medicine. An amount of time is required to get the job done like car, aircraft, missile, train manufacturing, surgery, and medication. have seen schemes parading on YouTube Facebook, and Instagram claiming to make profit of $2000-$7000 within 2-3days trading or investing, ignoring the fact that trade is complex algorithm programmed to make customers lose or gain little even though the experts who claim to make such post or article look as real as possible, see such post as fraud. scammers and rippers.

Oh whoa…(x3) You know you love me, know you care Just shout whenever, and will be there You are my love, you are my heart And we would never ever ever be apart… Are we an item? Girl, quit playing We are just friends, what are you saying? Say there’ another and look right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time And was like… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Oh, for you would have done whatever And just can’ believe we ain’ together And want to play it cool, but ’ losin’ you will buy you anything, will buy you any ring And ’ in pieces, baby fix me And just shake me ’til you wake me from this bad dream ’ going down, down, down, down And just can’ believe my first love won’ be around… And ’ like Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Luda! When was 13, had my first love, There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was star-struck, She woke me up daily, don’ need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound, it skipped beat when see her in the street and At school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend. She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… ’ gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah) Now ’ all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah…) Now ’ all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah…) Now ’ all gone (gone, gone, gone…) ’ gone… Read Full Lyrics at iLyricsHub:",0,0.7480329275131226

"Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh. You know you love me, know you care, Just shout whenever and will be there. You are my love, you are my heart and we will never ever ever be apart. Are we an item? girl quit playing, we are just friends, what are you saying. Said there’ another, look right in my eyes, my first love broke my heart for the first time. And was like… [Chorus] Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine (repeat) Oh, for you would have done whatever, and just can’ believe we are not together and want to play it cool, but ’ losing you will buy you anything, will buy you any ring, And ’ in pieces, baby fix me and you shake me til’ you wake me from this bad dream. ’ going down down down down and just can’ believe my first love won’ be around. And ’ like… [Chorus] [Ludacris] Luda, When was 13 had my first love, there was nobody that compared to my baby and nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh was star-struck,she woke me up daily, don’ need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound, skip beat when see her in the street and at school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend. She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying…. [Chorus] Now ’ gone, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now ’ all gone. Gone, gone, gone, gone, ’ gone.",0,0.7176513671875
