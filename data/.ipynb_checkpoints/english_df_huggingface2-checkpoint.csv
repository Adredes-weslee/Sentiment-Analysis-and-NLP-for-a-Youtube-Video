"(..Baby..) Oh whoa…(x3) You know you love me, know you care Just shout whenever, and will be there You are my love, you are my heart And we would never ever ever be apart… Are we an item? Girl, quit playing We are just friends, what are you saying? Say there’ another and look right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time And was like… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Oh, for you would have done whatever And just can’ believe we ain’ together And want to play it cool, but ’ losin’ you will buy you anything, will buy you any ring And ’ in pieces, baby fix me And just shake me ’til you wake me from this bad dream ’ going down, down, down, down And just can’ believe my first love won’ be around… And ’ like Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Luda! When was 13, had my first love, There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was star-struck, She woke me up daily, don’ need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound, it skipped beat when see her in the street and At school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend. Read Full Lyrics at iLyricsHub:",1,0.6765061020851135

"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; man with brown eyebrows, beard, mohawk, and golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding hog. Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in push. At the same time, he can also function as tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent' hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender' part, though be wary of spells. Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter' splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent' go-to counter is swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn' very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not good idea to send in Hog Rider simply to destroy building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King' Tower. If Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent' card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider' health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent' side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have smaller hitbox than passive building, which means if that if defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent' side, Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’ landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind tank in large push. Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player' King' Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be method of mitigating all damage dealt to Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King' Tower' health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of back door three crown. better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. Hog Rider combined with Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent' defenses thin. However, building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both swarm bait and damage combo. It is very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with swarm. If this happens, use spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini ..... combo. Both units are fast but the Mini ..... does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini ..... can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent' deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.",1,0.7068136930465698

"Hey, Jesus loves you! He already died on that cross for you, with the biggest act of love, making possible the impossible, and he will always be by your side. “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel”, as Mark 1:15 says. Jesus is the only path to the father, where are you going to address? Either heaven or hell? Are you addressing to an eternal life with God or an eternal life separated from him in suffering?.",1,0.9706851840019226

"Justin is 3 in half years older than me and remember when was 13, was 130 pounds and their was this magazine cover that said that he only weighed 108 pounds. literally hated myself for being younger and weighing more than him. That magazine cover might have been lie but still, somehow remember this. He used to be probably the most hated man on the planet back then think it was out of pure jealousy due to how famous he was and how every girl loved him. He was so famous so young and it’ sad how lot of the people around him were influencing him badly and he grew up way too fast. Of course he made the decisions he did so he has to take responsibility for it but the industry really put him through lot. just hope he’ truly happier now.",0,0.9346521496772766

"For it will be like man going on journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master' money. Now after long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, have made five talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over little; will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, have made two talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over little; will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, knew you to be hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, So was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that reap where have not sown and gather where scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ Matthew 25:14-30 ESV",0,0.6310349702835083

"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment. Hebrews 9:27 ESV For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 ESV But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 ESV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 ESV Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 ESV Truly, truly, say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 ESV For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:14 ESV Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 ESV Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Galatians 6:7 ESV For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins Hebrews 10:26 ESV Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. Matthew 7:13-14 ESV What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him 1 Corinthians 2:9 ESV And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 ESV",1,0.7121231555938721

"It is reserved for men to die once, and after this—judgment. Hebrews 9:27 LSV And God commends His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ died for us; Romans 5:8 LSV For God so loved the world that He gave the only begotten Son, that everyone who is believing in Him may not perish, but may have continuous life. John 3:16 LSV Convert, and each of you be immersed on the Name of Jesus Christ, for forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 LSV Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, say to you, if anyone may not be born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the Kingdom of God. John 3:5 LSV For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God; Romans 8:14 LSV He who is believing in the Son has continuous life; and he who is not believing the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 LSV Do not be led astray: God is not mocked; for what man may sow—that he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 LSV For if we are sinning willingly after receiving the full knowledge of the truth—there remains no more sacrifice for sins. Hebrews 10:26 LSV Go in through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it; how narrow is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to life, and few are those finding it! Matthew 7:13-14 LSV “What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and on the heart of man did not come up, what God prepared for those loving Him” 1 Corinthians 2:9 LSV And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world, for testimony to all the nations; and then will the end arrive. Matthew 24:14 LSV",1,0.7555434107780457

"How to be saved and be right with God for eternal life! 1-Admit you are sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God. 2-Believe onto Jesus Christ,who being the begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as free gift. 3-Confess onto God,asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start new life being born again after being saved from your sins. Scripture links below. The romans road to salvation. 1.Romans 3:10, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"" 2.Romans 3:23, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” 3.Romans 5:8, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" 4.Romans 5:12 “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:"" 5.Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” 6.Romans 10:9, “That is thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 7.Romans 10:13, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. More scripture. John 3:16-17 16.""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” 17.”For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” Romans 5:8-9 8.""But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."" 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, 1.""Moreover, brethren, declare unto you the gospel which preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3.""For delivered unto you first of all that which also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”",1,0.8309770226478577

"Trust in Jesus, Hell is real and eternal! This is what the Bible says about it.. ""The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13: 41-42 Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven "" am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me."" John 14:6 Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU ARE SINNER. We have all broken God' laws and ten commandments.. ""Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God' name in vain..""(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, ""God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. ""But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and the lake of fire, “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever and they have no rest day and night” Rev 14:11 ""For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings. Read the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",1,0.8976824283599854

"remember the feeling of listening to this hymn 12 years ago, the feeling of closing your eyes and feeling that butterflies in the belly of the first unrequited love, of being happy with little, of being able to stay on the street without being in danger, of friends who are gone over the years, from the posts collected from justin, from the clips that artists released at that time. time that was too good, it seems that it will never go back to the way it was before, it' just rant. the songs had lyrics and the artists were successful for having beautiful voice. Nowadays anyone seems to be successful just by making song that you can dance to in tikoteco lol This song by justin reminds me of several moments in my life!

"This was very contagious earworm when it first came out, but then it became so overplayed it turned into 7th grade culture war of which girl hated the song more... but we all started dancing when the DJ would put it on during the school dance anyway! only know this song and maybe 2 more, but it has special place in my heart because it really captures that innocent and cutely naive feeling of childhood crushes and having your heart broken for the first time. When you are older it' like an old dream but younger you thought it was the end of the world. 🤭 don' normally ramble in music video comments but this song is so nostalgic to me now.",1,0.6657769083976746

When was thirteen, had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came to between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was starstruck She woke me up daily, don' need no Starbucks She make my heart pound skip beat when see her in the street and At school, on the playground But really want to see her on the weekend She knows she got me dazing Because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking But just keep on saying",0,0.609195351600647

"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment Hebrews 9:27 ESV But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 ESV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 ESV Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 ESV Truly, truly, say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 ESV For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:14 ESV Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 ESV Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Galatians 6:7 ESV For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins Hebrews 10:26 ESV Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. Matthew 7:13-14 ESV What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him 1 Corinthians 2:9 ESV",1,0.8012943267822266

Not Shit. should start with proof reading first. ’ interested in learning what BTM’ Are. And hence as such may start my ATM Academy Journey. I Have got greater gasp on the accounting. The House Marketing is about to start fluctuating flow. You need to spray the outside of the house. And redo the cocking. Especially if the ground has shifted and it is no longer straight up attached to the floor. That way so that as you go to change clear ou the vents all the critters that were probably kept away from the what was once clogged vents do not just come running in. When you fix problem left side must equal right side before you make move. You need to have closure adn grow through the experiences. Set you systems. With Good bones. Hozier Marren Morris Song Inspo. And then life lessons. That you send back send out to people. And then whole new power of habit for the new system. The fixed system. Because before you had the broken system and that is where the muscle memory will// may go. Also remember why you left? And or why you did not want to do it before hand and account for those? New jobs will be created then. Whether that was spread to thin. Needed time to recharge. Safely. Not just physically but emotionally. That what Libra system is. Clearing the Vents system but you have got to account for that. Emotional Wealth counted like when working in retail. Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, but now the second quarter will have two functions the 2nd Quarter and as well as the semi annual sale. That Is why everyone is running business, working from home, and doing make up and having morning routines. Were preparing for the morning rush. You have to get used to learning about your home and running it like business because we have been home so much. The Lady of Proverbs. House Wife. “Run it like business” — Jay . Jigga keeps ish popping. It took while for me to get there though. Okay SO Second Quarter and as well as semi annual will need like equality and equity. And when people end shift like at cash. You balance out there till before they leave. Hence sometimes most times people leave in batches. Like batch content. Like the Tiktok trends posted on Youtube. Because you do not want to call at store closing for questions and or concerns about till closing at mid day. And so when if people are coming in and or out of your life during pandemic you may want to do some emotional closure. Even if it is quick short and sweet. What did you learn. Your good to go thank you. So that way it is not too much of culture shock going forward into the new world. mean if you are making some lifestyle changes. It’ be great to jot something is down. So that in the event of possible mud slide you have deep roots and won’ possibly fall down. Mud slide too much sweetness. Umm there is things where Most Times trees with deep roots tend to survive in the event of mud slide. Although if you can prevent the mud slide all together, “prevent is better then cure” — My Gma. But you are trying to live in this life not prevent it and nor run into all on coming danger. And so more places should just regularly have seasonal employment. Like if retail is hiring more people then that is lot of contracts, whoever does the law for those business should have more seasonal hires hired ahead of time. That is why some people do not always make it home for Christmas because they are out working late because the work piles up. So head office and Corporate should have seasonal hires. Its great for turn over. Flushing in new air. Also gives university students, paralegals step in the door. Low Risk Low reward. They get to see if they like it before doing all the work to graduate. Before fully committing to employment career path after they have acquired all the school debt. And or done all the work. Only to realize that they hate the career and or hate the way that it is done. Set up to fail and or “Built to fall apart” — Taylor Swift Out of the woods song inspo. You know how all thin people are liek sheep hearded towards Modeling like we do not really make room for them within society; yet. Like if you were tall and thin where can you get your clothes?!?! Liek for real? Like I Am like 5,4. And the clothes the pants just touch my ankles. If not fully cover them. How are tall people just shopping on the regs. Like it must be really hard. And that is not even tall and curvy; yet. Liek School can be an Emotional Everest. And its liek some places know that. And make business where you have to pass through the invitation process surpassing the Emotional Everest sometimes at the expense of your Mental Health. And then run business where you do not yet get to sample, and that sometimes they know they do not liek but liek sell it to you at full charge. And then you are stuck with the bill. Like if you need the degreee to get the job but then you need the job to continue to fund the education. By the time you graduate if you did not sell yourself or were funding by someone else, sometimes parents other times not. Then you need the job to pay off the debt and its not even if you fully like it or not. Its relying on burnt out love for affection. Like you are telling me that there is no entry level data entry jobs, that go around just more seasonally. Proofreading for parallels adn or English Lit students. Like why are University students coming back to Retail when there should be head office and or Corporate jobs that should be hiring seasonal. And then the workers are possibly overworked and or burnt out and or needing to pay for an expensive house. And or needing to buy secondary house and or condo closer to work on top of there house. If they are the fortunate ones who can afford financial aspects of the life that they are living. But the commute is taking toll on them Emotionally and or physically. But like they do not want to live in the city. They have done the hustle and bustle but yet there are not yet and corporate jobs outside of the city. But yet do not destroy from the home town aspect. And nor hometown feels and Nor home towns sky lines. And nor hometown spaciness. Like why is everything so compacted and clsuter. Who has yet to find content and is still living at with an alarming rate of abundance. Hoarders WHy do some people live with so much stuff. Just content on content on content where is the substance. Fear of branching out maybe of fear of possibly being forgotten. What good is keeping friends around if you lose yourself in the process?!?!? That Is what I Have got so far. Scorpio Season Peak Planning Season. And Team Spirit Like For Athletic Games. Sports Teams that have the best team spirit and or motivation. Or just overall all Motivation from just general sports. And then Summer Patio Season. Winter Peak Christmas Season. Libra Season Peak Closure Season. But you hire for seasonal well in advance. Or just sometimes in Advance. said what said, hope this helps. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.5223922729492188

Through rape, molestation and or spiritual leeches and or energy vampires. When people are sometimes too problematics can be draining you of all of your posible energy. With possible gaslighting, being difficult, crossing of emotional, spiritual boundaries. Taking things after you have said no. Constantly stealing your stuff. Starting problems where there were none. All the broken telephone. Drama baiting. Name calling. Fake news. Games. Projecting. Telling the wrong story in hopes// so that you can correct them and they can get the right tea. All of the thunder stealing. Knowing what you are about to do and then doing it first. Or waiting until you are about to do something so that they can do that something just so that they can go in front of you. Or the getting rid of that thing just because they know that you are about to do it. The belittling. The out downs. The constant harassment. And the triangulating.

"heard one of Justin biebers fans killed herself because she wanted to get close to him and he didn' visit her grave or atleast send her flowers he didn' give shit but in those times back when that happened the biebs was at another stage in his life it was time when he really didn' give shit about his fans he called one of his fans whale claiming that she was fat then he called black people niggers he said Jaden what happens when you get chainsaw ""run nigger nigger nigger"". mean why is the government protecting protecting this piece of shit he doesn' deserve it he doesn' even have real talent he just says baby baby baby oh like baby baby baby no like baby baby baby no one thing comes to mind Michael Jackson "" do not have to make political Statement my music goes all around the world all around the world"". Michael you will always be the king of pop the press called you wacko jacko and mistreated you just wanted your children to live much more normal life than what you experienced your body guards turned their back on you, family wasn' close to you, and man who was supposed to be helping you ended up killing you even if you told him give me the milk or will fire you and the Dr did should have never happened You by long long shot have made mark on our world much of the like of any body we have ever seen and we should all be forever grateful for that you your music and what you sacrificed for us. You are forever supernova celebrity who is someone with immense immense celebrity status that even the politicians of your day loved you and celebrated you and your music. You are the most awarded artist of all time and you accomplished much much more thank you for always doing right by us so we can do right by you currently in life, in the Afterlife, and through your death you may not be alive but your music lives on and please do not let Justin Bieber be you because he doesn' even appreciate his fans.",1,0.6903071999549866

"Something people should know about is the Thomas theory. This theory posits that things perceived to be real are real in their implications. Now, TV commercials do this. Like noom. Noom seems to be on journey of success, which makes us buy it. It started off not giving much information about the app. Now, the commercials start to reveal details about how it works. This is evidence of the Illuminati. See, they feign humility. They control business this way, by faking Christian theology, like, the humble shall be exalted, so we perceive it that way.

"this song unfolds very _irritating_ memory of my life was coming home from school in our van. don' know how we ended up having this but my brother and were asked to sing the ""Ouhwa"" part in the beginning of this song. didi in our van was judging us. didn' remember what the exact tune of the part was, so ended up singing the end part like run instead of slowly. Then my brother sang that part with the correct tune. That didi said that my brother sang it better. was so irritated because knew that was singing it right with the tune remembered, but my brother went slightly off key accidentally few times. Like can' describe how angry felt. mean how dare she judges us without knowing anything about music and not having sense of music at all. know that sang right, just that sang the end part bit fast. Otherwise my tune was right. That day went home and asked my mother to judge us, because of course she knows music 100 times better than that didi. Ah no, 100 times 0 is 0. So should add. She judged us and gave Justin Bieber 10/10, me 9/10 and my brother an 8/10. That was both before and after listened to the real song to recall the tune. That didi just thought that just because she is older, she knows better. Haha but no. Just because you are older, doesn' mean you are better at something you have no talent in. Who is she to judge music, huh? didi done releasing my anger, may go",0,0.9545711874961853

"This video is member of the small, exclusive ""Billion Views"" club, so it' bit surprising to me that this video is also one of the most disliked videos of all time, at one point pulling the #1 slot for most disliked video (from March 2011 until it was passed up on December 13, 2018 by YouTube' own ""YouTube Rewind 2018,"" and then later by ""Baby Shark Dance"" and ""Sadak 2 Trailer"")? According to Wikipedia, it is now the #4 most disliked video with 13.51 million dislikes as of December 2021. Do that many people hate this song that much or does it have something to do with the video itself? Perhaps the choreography' similarity to Michael Jackson? Or is it as simple as silly trolls being silly trolls and doing their silly trolling, as trolls do?",0,0.9769877791404724

"have the question ""pride, or mortified??"" here as an item, in the records of the parents here, where pride means delighted, not at all proud!! So do that now, change it to delighted, not proud, if you have parents around, who doesn' give it to you, as ""good person"" here, that you should be, and behave with too!! This is so GEEKY, we rot here!! ' looking at MTV, with Jersey Shore, and Tori Spelling!! So they brought it up, so they must know it!! So it' proud of you, no, just delighted in you, that goes here!! In all the countries too, so change that now, and understand that we don' get delighted by the other ones here, if we are Evil, or from Goodness!! So ' not delighted in an Evil person, but can be proud of it, if it eats it' ass up, and poos it out too!! That' very delightful too, and will go proud then!! That' all good to me!! So shift that on the inside, and say delighted, instead of proud!! will do that too!! So do that now, everyone here!! Thank you!! //",0,0.7506285905838013

"got to admit, like the song, but don' like the video. Like, it doesn' make any sense.

"love this song, because if it wasn' for him putting in effort to try to impress the girl he likes(in this case in the movie girl with blur jacket and skinny jeans) Right when they were going to leave the bowling alley Justin sees girl catches interest and the girl is just talking with friends and he' anxiously in hurry so his buddy does handshake which indicates ""you got this man go get her!!"" So he tries to show he likes her by going out of turn and she' just like staring at him and then he gets few down and she goes she made lot and sassily walked away with smile so he follows her in his mind wow game on let' play so he chases her around the whole bowling alley and she pushes him away everytime saying she just wants to be left alone don' likke him back and love the ending it' my favorite they all dance together and she' little convienced ok maybe he' not to bad then she starts to trust him and ends up falling for him they leave holding hands. So the purpose behind this song kind of goes well with the background story so yeah just strive for what you want and actually keep the person you want you can' just give up",1,0.9867806434631348

"there was cute girl in my class during ms who remember singing part of the lyrics to this during math class while we were using class time to finish some homework. not sure if she was fan or not, she did get wisecracks at her name being similar to Justin Bieber'. And maybe some teasing for being fan?

"Some information about the condition: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is caused by the varicella-zoster virus living in the facial nerve, creating inflammation and paralysis in one side of the face. The virus can remain dormant for decades in person who has had chickenpox as child. It is treated with antivirals, and facial paralysis and hearing loss can sometimes become permanent. On March 12th, 2022, his wife Hailey Bieber suffered mini-stroke due to small hole in her heart (Patent foramen ovale, congenital heart defect) from which the clot traveled to her brain. She underwent surgery to close the hole which she said was between 12 and 13 millimeters. Wishing the best for their health.",0,0.6623242497444153

"Hand in hand we walk around the roads during midnight. Under the gaze of moon we talk about our days Spending our time together, cooking and watching our best loved shows Our laughter blooms in the empty walls while chasing each other Reading our favorite poetry and books Embracing each other flaws with hugs Kissing each other pain so every tear become reason of joy. Leaning on each other during hard times And be the reason of happiness. Addicted to our mischievous adventures Flattered by the honest appreciation and The respect that never seems to be undone Becoming more powerful by being only one Our eyes become the witness of our love Telling how beautiful we are with one another🦋️❤️✨",1,0.988891065120697

If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don' stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don' dwell on things from the past, don' stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you.

"Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 So you can have your work friends, personal life friends, sports friends, neighbours, etc. And you can mix and match. But mostly you know who is who and which is better for if you are to want to mix and match. Adn so that it is not too messy. If your work friend choses not to help you with your hurting heart then tjhats okay that is your work friend. If they may chose to connect with you on human count yourself in as person quotient then that is great too. If they chose to help you as friend then that is an added bonus. Its not always snakes and ladders. But some work friends can get close like personal life friends and some personal life friends can drift like to an emotional distance of work friend. It happens. But more importantly it is to help you manage your emotional expectations. But also mostly so that if you need to keep your metronome and keep the beat should you lose your footing and need to reset and get your footing again and again. Then ou have other areas and boundaries emotional and otherwise and that provides that safe space to fumble that what is expected of you in those various areas. Which could help you to skateboarding should you fall. So that you don’ fall full stop which is soo not good for your heart. You want to walk it off. Always. Keep rolling. But this is so that you do not roll to far away from even you. You know. So that you don’ risk potentially losing yourself past the storm to the point where even you cannot yet recognize yourself even. And then your self care unwind natural methods are for end of the night recap. End of the night unwinding. So then you already have your life and patterns which can help you should you need to run on autopilot. You can rely on your systems and people and environments. It does not mean that you do not need to let anyone in. Its just so that if // should you get caught up in storm you can have systems CPR emotional health and safety so that you can weather the storm until yes in terms of emotional storms too “This too shall pass” ;). But having that space where you are okay within your self care. Have found home within your soul. And found comfort within your own comfort aspect of self care. have your own outlets, spaces, for not just walking but settling down and getting deeper roots within you. It can help with when you are solid who you may chose to let in, emotionally. So that you can check in with should your wold start to slip through your fingers, for minute or two. But if you have not yet find that then you may close the doors for minute and weather the storms. Liek if the clothing store is soo busy and has so much turnover and the sales and clothes and people are buying and your store is making soo much money. But the store is starting to look liek soo much of mess. And so you make the judgement call to close the store during the peak of peak super cress peak to clean up and reset and reposition every to new areas. To clean to rehydrate. To emotionally reset. Grow through the experience since it is an unprecedented peak of peaks and have people in various sections to help people with what they need in where it can get various help. People don’ more from there work spaces. If you need something use your walkie talkies and we’ send floaters to use. Back stock is in back stock. And if should it get peak christmas shopping season in June then you call in your call in’. And you call in some extras and allocate for it. And call in your back up. Call in your other managers. ANd inform head office of just what is happening. So that the communication is still flowing. So that there is communication and support. And then you can account for more health and safety. Maybe even have shopping limits for such peaks. Guage and have people at the door to gauge how many people go in before you open back up. SO that way you won’ have to close up shop during peak hours again. ANd then let people in like its club. Maybe. Either way it is to account for health and safety and LP (Lost prevention) you know. Its whole new work system but its kind of just translate work peak seasons. You know. Either way it is to protect the worker and worker staff too. Its liek if Union station and or any other train station had an early morning and or after work rush hour packed with people during liek mid day. ITs like we prepare for that but this time slot, this time frame. Its (the peak // rush of people is not usually at this time) okay we know the systems let us go. And then later check why there was so much peak. what was happening within the community that maybe was not yet accounted for to learn better for next time. Pan Am games are near by and have break around noon. The more you know. Because planes, trains and autombiles, police, restaurants, etc all prepare for when there is game in the city. YOu just already know going in ahead of time that there will be most likely will be may be alot of traffic because of game night home court game night, you know. Stuff like that. But sometimes an away game is switched to home game. But that cost money time and energy. The proper people need to be relocated enough to allocate for it. Or else huge health and safety risk and then the city might just have to shut down for the time being in order to protect the people. Everyone involved. So its really about having different environments. To simplify think of staying within your own lane as when driving on the highway. During rush hours. Bxtch do not sware. You could crash and or hit another car. And some roads are one way you cannot just haev cars in places any and any how. Like having the on coming traffic in the next lane right beside you on the collectors the person in the next lane is going west but you are on the collectors going east. YOu see how that can really fxxk you up. And so nothing wrong with wanting to be going east on the collectors on the highway, but there is lane and space for that. That being said you can switch lanes indicate. But driving during peak hours rush hours is not the same as driving late at night when there are less cars on the road. mean still be safe. But there is little more lee way when indicating and merging lanes. But still please try and say east on the east lane. aNd west on the west road. said what said. hope that helps. Anyways feel free to take country road time or two. The highway is not all there ether is in this everywhere. But maybe just in this lane, section of the road. hope you dance songs inspo. Both version. <3. hope that helps with having different sections. In terms of guarding your heart. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.5955910086631775
"“Be Busy Like The Wise Ant” — tHB. Also needing some different types of friends. “Lean Not On Your Own Understanding” — tHB. #RepostedPicture Via Critical Thinking. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Me Too. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Absent Friend and or also needing some different types of friends. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. You need friends with whom it is easier to communicate with. And or who just naturally understand you method of communication. You need to “Lean not on your own understanding” — tHB. And do some deep dives and or research to different// various different methods of communication. And see which method works best for you. Take few more things personally. Count yourself in as person. Do you like being here? Feeling like this? Being in this environment? Feeling the way that you are feeling within your environment? There are various ways to do anything and so why then chose to do anything in such way. Why does this way work best fr you? What about branching out and trying different ways to try things. What about seeing the bottom line? What are you doing? But does it get you? What need does it meet? What outlet do you use? What process do you go through? What ends are met by these means? And then the power of habit. Are there other ways to translate your outlets? Have your needs met in healthy, stronger, more emotionally awoken way, etc? Healthier safer? Why about trying to make room for your own little world in the real world. So that you are not always living in your head. You can read in your room. But what about branching out and reading in different rooms, places adn or environments. Nothing wrong with going to beach and or library every now and then. That being said nothing wrong with starting your own book club. Various kinds of book clubs. Just place to read quietly in room with some friends. With whom you can do your own thing inter independently. Where you can share comfortable and or proper alone time. Still safe. Still health and safety. Where you can not hide the sayings of the dark. Talk TikTok Social Media App Family Tea then. All in all make room for your own little world within the real world. It can really help you to stay present. ANd not lose your head within all your many thoughts. Also “Be Busy Like The Wise Ant” — tHB. Find your vibe. Find your tribe. Find your colony. Nothing wrong with little safe and healthy branching out every now and then. Okay and for “Go[ing all] out … to give you any help you need” — Critical Thinking Facebook Page. Maybe then try and have some safe and healthy limits. So that you don’ go too far. And risk possibly Over stretching your spirit. And or possibly going soulless. No Limit Song Inspo By Easy and Them. So maybe “Draw line before you cross it” — Eminem. Circle around where you would like to go. Know the whole limits of that space. Seen the whole 365. And then break it up into smaller more manageable sections. Like chunking. Time Chunks. Waves. Algebra. Brackets. With various things to do and then various sections. Like different classes, books, chapters, sections. And or various tasks like cleaning the house and then running errands, keeping fit, school, work, etc. What do you have to do? Maybe walk to some of your errands. And or take the car and then go on the walk after all the erands. But cleaning take energy and effort. Dishes, laundry, sweeping, etc. Sections within sections. plates with plates, cutlery, cups, soak them accordingly assembly line. And then errands what is the groove so that that works best with you too. Work within your sections. You can run your errands as you let the dishes soak. After you seperate and put load in. And or just serperate the laundry for washer. And then put them quick wash. And then pile them in the dryer. Until the load of clothes is big enough and then dry whole load of clothes all at once. ANd then you can hang up some of the other clothes while you wait. And And then while the dishes are soaking adn the laundry is being done you can already cleaned the table and swept the floor. And then you can go about your errands. You can leave the house with the laundry machine and dryer going just not the oven. If you do not want to use that time to clean the bathroom and or washrooms also. And by the time you go through all of that. After you clean the bathrooms you can take shower. And then leave the house clean. By then the laundry is done so you can spend that time folding. You can clean while in the zone and or while introspective but introspective within your house as the location has been secured. After the laundry is folded the dishes should be soaked enough adn you can wash them easily. And of if no need to soak anything. You can just clean room to room. ’ clean kitchen, bedroom, washroom, bathroom, shower and then run my errands. Most importnat ones and or the stocked up quick ones all at once. Not start with heavy and or long errand so as not to overwork myself internally. Id sleep in and wake up chill AF and then go and run that errand on my sarcathian rhythm when feel more charged up. So as not to potentially risk burn out; you know. All in all please try not to leave the house with low energy and heavy lot of thing to do. Take that big goal and break it up into smaller goals. And or feel free to invite friend and or some friends and or family members with you. You want to be energized and or half massed but enough to pay attention to your surroundings. Denying tasks, goals, obligations is not just good for your mental health and to protect your inner peace. But also for your physical and sexual pyschlogical health. So that you are least likely to be attacked because you will be energized enough to be paying attention to your surroundings and hopefully busy like the wise ant. said what said. hope this helps. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. And as for your whole heart. Find your passions interest and hobbies. Your baselines, metronomes and parent functions. Your routines. To help ground you. To help keep you solid. And then again keep your fulfilment, your speck and then get honest, with it. Go to places and people and spaces that feel like peace and bring peace to you. Diversify Diversify Diversify. You don’ need one sieze fits all for every area of your life. But it is good to be able to grow in your environments, like also able to expand, upgrade and or just branch out. “There is time for everything” — eCC, tHB. Like space for home, home away from home, school, work, library for studying after school, sports, at school away from school in sports club and or where you train away from school let people various people know where to come find you so that you can have back up in the event that should you get ambushed and or be under attack, you never know it could save your life. And then there are various friends in various areas. So that you also can have different like environments for different versions of you. Your work self, sports self, school self, proper alone time self. So that you can get to know people. And maybe even let them in. But there is way to behave in school that you do not really need to behave at home. There is way to behave at work where you don’ need to behave at// during sports. Especially if it is sports for fun and or as cathartic outlet. To let some air, energy, aggression, emotions out. But have limits there too. Sometimes its good to have deadline before you start too. So then you can not just account for your breaks. And yes have breaks. But also so that you know like potato clock when it is time to go. So that you can stay peak energy and not just drone on and on. You know help and better guard your heart, mind, spirit soul energy and vibes too. Blood of Jesus Red Too. Best, .

"“Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. Try Eating little Bit More Consistently. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. When you eat on the regular food does not feel like heroine running through your veins because you have not yet eaten in such long time. But its okay in the process you can learn about snacking. Which can keep you from being over fed, in order to numb your gut instincts. The gift of fear — Book Inspo by Gavin DeBecker. “Listen To Your Tummy Buzzer” — Tiktoker. Time not wasted. Time well spent. You don’ over eat any and any where with any and anyone. It can be like getting sloppy drunk and or just getting so drunk that you pass out. Your gut instinct may be surpressed in which your tummy is breaking down sooo much food that your tummy buzzer is suppressed in which someone could use that as an opportunity to take advantage of you emotionally, spiritually, soulfully maybe even via overly sexing you out. To get access to your spirit and or soul, with and or without your permission. Some people are having really good sex. Others are spiritually and or soulfully eating up on your fulfilment bodies. Be careful. Eat before you go on date and or to hang out with friends. Some people can get you too drunk to hear your secrets to then later try adn use them against you. ANd or to tell everyone else. While others may get you too drunk to try adn take advantage of you not just emotionally, spiritually, and or soulfully but also emotionally!?!?!? If you would not tell them that when you are sober then you should not really be telling them that when you are too drunk, too full, too tired, too high, etc. If you are in no condition to actually safely drive then you should not be spilling your guts and or using the vehicle that is your body, mind, spirit, soul, brain, heart, etc. “Above all things guard your heart” — pROVERBS, tHB. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 You would not blow up every time you are not if you ate little bit more consistency on the regular. ""For it is not the letter of the law, but the fulfilment of the law"" -- Jesus debating with the Pharises. And that does just go for food your your mind and body. But food for your spirit and soul also. Are you eating your fruits of the spirit; yet? What about your vegetables of the soul? If not if you hold out too long getting love, joy peace, after such long time it can feel like crack cocaine after long time. But being desperado and really really needing food for the spirit and or body. Needing that love joy peace because its been like forever it can feel like heroine. Quite fix but its still cheap and you can tell the difference. have not actually done heroine but have felt love from someone who is desperado adn can tell you the real thing is wayyy so much better. Don' starve people to love you. An don' starve yourself until you get the love that you want. Have your limits but then translate your outlets to other appropriate outlets, like various passions interst and hobbies. But do not leave yourself starved. You know when you have not yet eaten for bit and then you get bit of meal and you thought you could go for snack but then end up eating the whole not realizing that were actually starving and that it had actually been awhile since you last ate. And that you were actually starving not just little hungry. Know that about yourself. Don' let other people take advantage of that part of you because you decide to possibly embrace ignorance in the matter. ""Do not embrace ignorance"" -- tHB. When you stop loving with your heart. And or thinking with your brain. And or trusting your gut instincts. Just like if you stoped walking for bit. And or so long. Those are all muscles. And if you do not use them then you could lose them. Your muscles could atrophy. Die off. You know that people who are anorexic, they don' actually die from not eating. They die because the body has no more food in the stomach and has exhausted all other options and then starts to eat off the muscles of the heart. Like your stomach and or just your body starts to eat your heart. And believe it or not but your body will not actually go down without fight. It really is mind over matter. ""Rage Rage Do Not Go Gently Into That Goodnight"" -- Poem. And so it is the same with your brain, it will not go down without fight. And so maybe you won' eat but your brain will// may take over and you may// will eat when you black out and go hungry. And so then it is your demons then who are feeding you. And when you black out and its like hold your breath even if you don' yet want to breath you can only hold your breath for so long and then you are going to need to inhale. You Are brain is not going to go out without fight. #Stiles from #TeenWolf. When Stiles went Evil. Bad Moon Arising Song Inspo. All To Well Taylor Swift The Movie Video Inspo Too. Maybe. On Human Quotient Version then. You Are going to do it anyways live in an emotional surplus. Why do not you want to eat; yet? It keeps you from emotionally swinging on the ropes. You an get up but you don' yet have safe way down. What is your baseline, grounding techniques for when you are on the ground anyways, before you go get up for The Miley Cyrus Climb?!?!?! What is your metronome, beat drop, parent functions, systems, The Power of Habit working out for you on the regularly!?!??!?!? ""If you stand for nothing then you may very well fall for everything"" -- unknown, don' know yet. And so now you know that you need life but also full life before you decide to try and aim for more. How do you count yourself in? Make room for you to be you within your life. What do you stand for? How do you create system of familiarity and regularity within your own life? Especially before stuff really starts to take off and life really starts to get going in what can sometimes feel insane especially during peak season if you do not yet have base to help prepare you with ahead of time; yet. Get ready ""Winter Is Coming"" -- GOT. But But winters peak season equivalent is of course SUMMER Peak Patio Season. What' wrong with being confident? There are many peak seasons? Are you ready for it? Demi Lovato - Cool for the Summer (Official Video) Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",0,0.5142132639884949

"Here are 100 reasons to live Family Friends Small talk with strangers The happy moments that only last few seconds The smiles from small children The memories with animals Eating you favorite food The excitement of the fairs Vacations with your family Getting your first car Graduating highschool Getting into good college Graduating college Starting your new career path Birthdays The smell of winter Hanging out with friends Job promotions Pumpkin Pie Thanksgiving Dinner Halloween Black Friday Movies Sleep overs Catching your dreams Binge watching on Netflix Homecoming Prom First Date First Kiss Christmas Morning Fireworks New Years New Discoveries Flowers Rainy Days Blankets coming out of the dryer on cold morning New relationships nice cup of tea Reading good book Drinking coffee on an early morning The joy of being sarcacstic Hidden talents Small acomplishments Adeventure The mystery of the fog The fantasy of going to never land Baby showers Weddings The big blue ocean Inside jokes with friends Family reunions walking around with colorful fuzzy socks Being able to wear whatever you want around your house The comfortable silence between two people Doughnuts snow ball fights The tooth fairy Jumping over waves The pure laughter from someone Star gazing Being weird Being diffrent Being unqiue Being Yourself Listening to you favorite song Singing in the shower Being complete goofball with your best friend Having good personality The calm before any storm The sound of thunder Looking up at full moon Imagination The feeling over proudness Baking The smell of coffee in the morning Writing Stories 2-3am talks with someone Rollercoasters Cookies Completing hard task The sound of the fire cracking on summers night Naps Walking in the words on spring afternoon Jumping in leaf piles Climbing trees The moments when you say "" Did everyone see that? Because am not doing that again"" The feeling of wrapping yourself in fuzzy and soft blanket The look of made bed Watching the leaves fall Long warm baths The smell of fresh fruit Waking up to no alarm clock Never giving up Seeing double rainbow Making one with your demons Seeing the sunrise Proving people worng Being able to take risks Being the light in every room that you walk into to, because no matter what people tell you you are amazing in every single way possible.

Ohh this is how you can help him. could not yet get to the ghost when he felt into the real life. 2017 was going down the escalator he was going up. walk alone. But from work to the food court. People know where and how to find me. He walks with friends. He knows how and when he walks with his friends. It was his friend that said “Hey Justin” when we were just staring. They confirmed it. would not have thought too too much about it. It really was just give me 7 years and be back. Then go back seven years and you will what is up. “You Have got to go back to go forward” — tHB. So the one going down the escalator is seperate from the one coming up the escalator. But the ghost from the one going down the escalator is in the one going up the escalator. So where is his ghost. Soulfully homeless?!?!?! do Isaiah 58 fasting. In letter and in truth. Fulfilment too.

Because those are great for me!!!!!! Especially when ’ on my period. And barfing// puking my guts out. And starving because can’ hold anything down. They are the only things that can eat. And they help to cool me down because then at that time tend to also sometimes overheat. was severely anemic. Anemic not anorexic. As in low iron. Get blood test and ask to check your iron levels. Also some blood test can now check for breast cancer in both men and women. do not yet know if that tech is out their for everyone just yet, still in the trials stages. But also if you are anemic low iron eat steak and or some mixed nuts// trial mix. And or some deep ready greens like spinach and or kale. Maybe likely cooked do not know about that part though. But low and slow so that you do not burn out the nutrients. Also over the stove oats cooked in milk for fibre. Like broccoli it helps you poop. You can die from being backed up for too long. But Its also good for the heart too. Got To get some shit off your chest you know. You cannot carry that weight around forever and ever. You Have got to learn to let things go. Ventilation is not poop. do not know what the spiritual equivalent of ventilation is but its not poop. ’ still figuring that part out. But anyways …… And so low iron. Iron is good for the blood. It helps to carry the oxygen around the body throughout the bloodsteam. It helped to keep me fed and cool when was overheating and could not yet eat anything. Also great in the summer when it really really hot. To just walk with one or two on the way out. To help to regulate your body temperature. Hence they have summer time music. It just comes in doses. Not needed all the time. Every day. Everywhere. Everyone needs their summer love. Summer fun songs. And Summer time cooling down system. As long as you are having fun and not feeling shitty and nor degrading yourself in order to do it. What is summer without summer patio season!?!?!? Also sometimes you buy the desserts until you are ready more comfortable to go in and buy the meal. It can still get you through the door. I Have learned of lot of fancy places before was ready to commit towards it. “ little bit of righteousness over lot of strife” — tHB. Maybe make some fancy places with not just desserts and nor kids menus but for meals for people who are just trying to branch out. You know. Also do not always want whole ass meal. Like kids seize of salmon is really all need. snack. like leftovers. Because those are the kinds of snacks that like. do not eat full meals and finish them all the time. My snacks are not always slices of fruits. Maybe make room for snack sizes of meals in fancy restaurants. Stay safe . Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",1,0.9137464761734009

"John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Luke 13:3 [3] tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Matthew 18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Luke 6:27-38 But say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. 2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Matthew 24:4-14 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name' sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. Exodus 20 King James Version 20 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for the Lord thy God am jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour' house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour' wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour'. ..,..,..,.., ........ ........ ........ ........ .,.,,.,. .,.,.,,",1,0.5053881406784058
