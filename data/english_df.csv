"Nah don’ know why this is in my recommendation, will never like anyone that spits on his fans and puppies…"
"message to every person who has not yet converted to Islam Peace be upon those who follow guidance. how is your heart? How is your life? are you happy? Or worried? Or upset? Is your heart shaken between entering Islam and remaining as you are? am addressing your heart, which has something within it that wants Islam, but is hesitant and perhaps afraid. My brother, live the beauty of Islam, the sweetness of Islam, and the mercy of Islam. Isn' it time for your heart to wake up from its negligence? Is it not time for you to return to God, Lord of the worlds, by entering Islam? Or are you tired of the path of Satan and his disbelief, look at the light within you, and leave the dark side. Take the darkness out of your heart, and enter the light that leads you to the truth. Or did you hear the word Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar in the call to prayer? Didn' you notice that God is greater than your worries, greater than everything, capable of changing the course of your life in the blink of an eye? Aslam, peace be upon you, rest and rest assured, and be happy, and your heart radiates happiness, mercy and satisfaction! My brother, God sent the Prophet Muhammad to all people, and he is the last of the messengers, so there is no prophet after him, and there is no happiness except in his religion, the religion of Islam. When was the last time you she would tears for fear of God, praying to Him to guide you to the right path? Have you forgotten God, God is one, one, there is no intermediary between you and God in the religion of Islam, so call upon Him whenever you want, for He sees you and hears you? Taste the sweetness of God' monologues in Islam; Because when you call upon Him in Islam, this is proof that you have removed from your mind the darkness that He has partner, for God has neither partner nor son, He is God the One who begets not and is not begotten, and there is no one equal to Him. invite you from my heart, which has known the sweetness of Islam and the mercy of Islam, to enter into it. ask God to open your heart to Islam, get up now, yes now, take bath and say: bear witness that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Feel these words, and you will feel comfort in your heart that you have not felt throughout your life."

"was blind, hating him just because didn' want to seem ""gay"" or get hate for liking him. Now old enough to realize there' no point in trying to seek others approval and will like what like. The things people hate about him, his ""attitude"" back in the day is not so unreasonable. Let' not forget he was many people' childhood celebrity crush and his songs are one of the gems hidden behind all this social media mess."
do not like any of its song

"remember hearing this song for the first time back in 2016, had it on replay all day long. And even in 2023, can' get enough of it. This song is perfection."
He knows TAYLOR SWIFT
This song and “Clover Cage - The Road to Awakening” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. just want to send love to everyone and want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together.. love you 💝
"That was long time when first heard this song, when ’ 4-5 years old. Its melody is still in my heart"
When Justin was innocent! 😢
We are so old this kid has wife now
"’ only doing this as torture method to make my friend suffer, will tell if it works."
this slaps
He has grown up so much
unironically though this song hits cuz of nostalgia
"My mother thought saw and heard this song for Justin, but did it for the girl lol, fell in love with the girl at my 8 years HAHAHAHAHA."

"It' probably the first song heard that remember very properly and definitely the first song know liked and wished to hear again. Brings back memories from my childhood man when life was so simple, no internet and no smartphones. Little, innocent and dumb me just getting lost in it' vocals. No worries of life, no stress of future or career and no idea of how big and full of different things, emotions, people and interests this world is Good times! ✨"
Justin look like my crush 😍
love this song
is that drake at 1:14
avish
"BABY- DEUXIEME PARTIE (Part 2) John 3:1-21 The etymology of ‘Baby’, slang common noun term of endearment especially between lovers, is nondescript, and innocuous at best. In short, no one knows when, who, why the term first came about, who started it ( thought it would be song) and why it was. To me now think it was probably shortcut for _ love, sex, pregnancy, partnership for life – ergo marriage and children intent. We were all once babies, and even GOD became baby for us so that rebirth that transcends death could be ours."
You are the first artist on my live
My favorite song 😭😭🤘🏻

Justin Bieber is legend
"If you where growing up around this time, you know how much hate he got.. and myself think about it from to time with how he got mega famous and all the name calling stuff must have been beyond tuff for him as kid but just as any person in general the hate was insane.. If know you know. JB goes down as one of the most hated in history but also one of the most famous in history. But regardless he’ goated. remember liking his music growing up, and being young boy at the time, you couldn’ even admit to liking his music.. like.. the hate was that bad. But know already mentioned this but now whenever have memory or something reminds me of Justin’ music, I Am always thinking about how the hate effected him and the fact that he was kid enduring all that too. Because when say that the hate was “insane” really mean it as he was one of the most hated ever. No exaggeration. But everyone respects him now cuz he’ an og so that’ good. But also too why people probably respect him more now is because back then, times were different. ’ not trying to go into all that here but for the ones who saw Bieber blow up, you know what ’ talking about and what mostly all of the hate centered in on. Bottom line is Justin Bieber and his song “Baby” made history for the best and the worst."
heard it 4 years ago and here am watching it again

"may be little kid But have been around Can hear the girls all scream Soon as our wheels touch down Junkets in Tokyo Fashion shoots in Milan Then private jet to Madison Square Garden Thirty six week long tours Ten singles on the charts So hear my message girl Because it comes from the heart Help me My parents sold me To big producer In the record industry He makes me do things That don' want to do Please call child services Or maybe SVU You got to help me My parents sold me To big producer In the music industry They took the cash and left me To the screaming masses If ' known all this ' skip those dancing classes tried to run away One time in Belarus They beat me with phone books So that wouldn' bruise just can' take no more Rich kid' bar mitzvahs Or paid sleep overs With Saudi princes Blinked ... in morse code Once at the VMAs They sprayed me with hose In pit for three days And when my sales drop off They will take me to resort And let rich business men Hunt me down for sport You got to help me My parents sold me To big producer In the music industry Oh, God please help me Please take some action This didn' work out For Michael Jackson Can someone help me Don' ignore what said They will sacrifice me To the god Baphomet"

Number one 🏆❤️🥇🤩
This is my favorite song🏆🥇🏆🥇
"It is amazing how person’ state of mind can alter the perception of time. ’ sure it only took 4 or 5 seconds to severe the rope from the tree, but it seemed like an hour. When the rope was cut, the knot fell to the ground, while the end of the rope zipped across the rocks and over the edge of the cliff, the speed of it causing humming noise as it went. As soon as the rope was cut, let out cry. He dropped the knife and fell backward. Watching the rope fly over the edge brought the feelings in the passage back to me. got up and headed toward the truck. noticed was still laying there, wide-eyed, staring at the point the rope disappeared. called to him, which seemed to break his trance. He got up and hurried away from the tree, the cave, the nightmare. Neither of us said word all the way home. It is now 4 days after our trip to the cave. It has taken me 4 days and dozens of attempts to get this entire experience written into my journal. Every time started to write recalled the terrible feelings had and couldn’ write anymore. felt compelled to continue, so as to document the unbelievable events while all of the details were fresh in my mind. can still feel the pain. Still smell the stench. Still experience the terror. Even typing from my journal has taken hours. would like to write more, but it will have to wait. Even now, with several days between me and the event, can’ relax. can barely concentrate. That’ all for now. 5/19/01 It has been three weeks since our last visit to the cave. want to update everyone as to my condition, my plans for the cave, and the events of the past few weeks. apologize for not returning your phone calls. have been getting all of your messages, just haven’ felt up to calling back. Steve and Marc, thanks for your words of encouragement on my answering machine. know you two are sincerely concerned for me. You are awesome friends. Marc, know you stopped by the house few times, and ’ sorry never answered the door. It really helped me just knowing you dropped by. Sis, can hear the worry in your voice. ’ .. Don’ worry about me. Just take care of those nieces and nephews of mine. figure if can get this site updated can let everyone know at once about how am doing. lot has happened in the last three weeks, so will do my best to cover everything. guess should start where the last entry left off. It took several days to get the last journal entry written down. was so shaken up from the experience that could do little else but sit around and ponder what had happened. Right now am on long term medical leave from work. tried to go to work several days after the event, but my boss sent me home. couldn’ concentrate and looked terrible. ’ve even been to the doctor, but couldn’ tell him about the experience, so just told him was under lot of stress. He recommended rest and gave me prescription to help me relax. Mmmmm! Good drugs! When we left the cave was nearly in state of shock. could not think clearly and was having difficult time trying to understand what had happened. didn’ eat much nor did get any sleep. was glad had the presence of mind to write down my experience while it was fresh in my mind. As re-read what wrote feel like accurately portrayed what happened in the cave that day. wouldn’ change anything wrote. Even though it took three days to write it, when finished writing in my journal felt much better. guess it was kind of therapeutic. Unfortunately, it didn’ last. In fact, it was after then that things got really bad. and parted company after the trip and didn’ see him again until yesterday. didn’ try to reach him, and he didn’ try to get hold of me. Nor did either of us try to contact Joe. just dropped me off after the trip and spent the next several days by myself in my house. tried to eat but had no appetite. was restless, but couldn’ find anything to do to take my mind off the experience. That’ when determined that should write it down. As mentioned, that helped me think little clearer, and seemed to be little calmer, but it didn’ last. went to work the next day but was sent home. The day after that had an overwhelming feeling of anxiety sink into my soul. was depressed and confused and had no one wanted to turn to for comfort. was getting all kinds of phone calls from people but just let the answering machine take the calls. even changed the message on the machine to let everyone know was alright. continued in this miserable state, eating and sleeping whenever could manage, until week after the trip. Then things started to get strange. At first, was hearing sounds in the house that had no explanation. Footsteps. Shuffling noises. Creaking doors. You know, the typical horror movie fare. Only the sounds were not distinct. It was as though wasn’ sure heard what thought heard. would be eating or getting out of the shower, and stop, thinking heard something. But the sound would not repeat itself. In fact, if it weren’ for the fact that it happened frequently, couldn’ be sure there were noises in the first place. Either way, was scared. It was as though had been caught in spider web for the last week. Feelings of anxiety, foreboding, and tension filled my life. Then came the hallucinations. began seeing things in manner similar to the sounds was hearing. Just glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. When would turn to look, nothing. had been sleeping with the lights on in my room, but now kept all the lights in the house on from before dusk to after dawn. When started to see things on regular basis purchased gun. Got it from an ad in the paper so didn’ have to wait for permit. went to the doctor but didn’ mention the details of my life. Just told him couldn’ relax, and walked out of there with prescription. Fortunately, my wounds and injuries were pretty much healed by this time. My back still hurt little, but the prescription took care of that, too. When was on the medication felt great, but didn’ want to walk around high the rest of my life, so would only take it at the end of tough day. Unfortunately, the severity of the sightings increased, giving rise to need for the medication. The flashes in the corner of my eye continued, but then began to see shapes and shadows. They would be outside my windows, usually at night. still couldn’ make out anything solid, so it was hard to pin down what was was seeing. Soon began to close all of my drapes and blinds so could remove the possibilities of seeing something. Doing so did help in that respect, but my life was still mess. My daily routine was mechanical and empty. would sleep in as long as could, usually out of exhaustion. Then would get cleaned up and try to eat something. lost lot of weight, so tried to get as much as possible down me. Then would exercise little and nap lot. ’ only been out of the house few times in the last two weeks. The store, the doctor, the gun purchase. didn’ watch much .. because couldn’ concentrate. spent lot of time on the internet. was doing research on caves and cave myths. The only story could find was the caver folklore about the Hodag. The Hodag is supposedly creature that roams caves. Two weeks after we went into the cave, and week after began hearing things, began to have nightmares. Extremely lucid nightmares. No specific theme or recurring events. Just plain terrifying. Sometimes was in my house and someone was trying to get me. Only couldn’ run because had no legs. Other times was in vat and someone was pouring syrup-like liquid on me, filling the vat. would wake up in panic. would stay awake until exhaustion forced me to enter dreamland once again. brutal routine. It continued for several days, until it reached climax on the sixth day (yesterday). My dreams seemed so real had hard time telling if was awake or not. was beat, really drained of energy and spirit. was going from the living room to my bedroom in the early evening when looked down the hall and saw dark figure toward the end. thought it was thief and began to back up slowly. It didn’ move. As was backing up the lights flickered off and on. Every muscle was tense. stopped to stare at the figure. Just then the phone rang! It startled me so bad stumble over the chair. When got up wheeled around to look down the hall and nothing was there! grabbed my keys and left the house. felt compelled to get in the car and drive. My pulse pounded in my temples as got in and started the car. wanted to drive to Overlook point to see the city lights. didn’ know why needed to go there, but knew had to go. The closer got, the more urgent the feeling. When arrived at the point, saw something that at first startled me, but then caused me to be more relaxed than had been in long time. Joe was there! He was out of his car, standing, looking at the lights. We looked at each other. could see from the tired look on his face he had been going through the same miserable trial that had been experiencing. He could tell from the look on my face that we had shared some terrible experience. Our conversation was unbelievably brief. “You been back?” he began, even though he knew the answer. “Yes.” “We need to return.” “Tomorrow good?” asked. “Yeah, noon.” He got in his car and got into mine. hadn’ even wanted to talk to him about his experience. Obviously, he didn’ want to know mine. drove over to ’ house."
Why is this kind of bop now

This guy has grown so much

feel like having fame at such young age for him is hard yea he had money but feel like pressure got to him to much and depression was caused ik he talked about it but on deep level it would be hard having so many fans at sucha young age and the pressure of being the best is going thru you are head daily eyes always on and people js be fuckin judging because goin thru sum

They both look so cute together in this video
"don' care who gets offended. This was and still is genuinely good song. We all just found it annoying how everyone went crazy over him. ' not saying this the best song ever, obviously, but for the stuff that comes out now that is just generic, bland, and manufactured, especially in this same genre, this song slaps feels real and holds up. regret this at one point being the most disliked video on YT. We did him wrong on that one."
justin biber love you so much since was 4 years old and will always love you love
"TikTok brought me here. Baby, noooo...."

When this song release trust me, me and my friends dance. and share this song with my friends in this 2023 date after 1 week we all gathered in my house and we remember that time. we all cry man we all cry , remembering that student life, remembering when we write and send love letters to girls, remembering all that shitty things what we do, remembering the relationship between us, remembering when get 35 marks in math and we all had party , remembering when we first time drink alcohol and many more things sorry can' write everything on the comment . If started to write all things than have to buy notebook 📝. What want to say to you who is reading my comment is if you are student trust me this is your best time in your whole life don' make this time useless . Student life friends are the best friends of your life trust me when you will join college or you finished your study and move to New place , and you remember that student life you are going to get so emotional, you going to cry, you going to start searching for your friends in social medias and many more. will not write everything down here, you are also going to suffer from this"

"The fact that the person who sang this song grew up with is now married. It’ insane, grew up with this song."
"Guys, trust me, try listening to Rauf&Faik.They are Russian pop duet of Azerbaijani origins, formed by twin brothers Rauf and Faik Mirzaev Most of their songs sound amazing 👏 because their voices and music are incredible! The way they sing touches my soul, feel hypnotised whenever listening to them, and since started listening to them, became fan of Russian music, and its sad 😔 that many people don' know those talented and adorable fraternal twins. If you listen to Rauf&Faik song called childhood, is this happiness? And the rest of the songs of them Wholeheartedly, you will definitely feel amazed and become big fan of them, especially their music, and voices will touch your heart ❤️ ❤ ❤"

2023 still fav song😂🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
the fuck? why he sing when brian needed 🤣
confess that find this music collaboration involving Justin Bieber and Ludacris catchy to listen to. The bowling alley and pop dancey type of music add fun carefree music energy to the song despite the obvious song meaning.
How many of watching this song in 2023💜🔥
' in my forties and this is one of my favorite songs. It' 2023.❤❤❤
Ikr
This is so Amazing ❤
"2023, June,"
2023 anyone????????
"miss the days when people were memeing the Bieber to death. We were young and the internet was better, and the flame wars were very much alive but also fun. And now those days are gone and everyone grew up, just like the Bieber who is now approaching his 30s. The new generation will never know what it was like back in the early 2000s up to 2010, and that is kind of sad."
2024 anyone ?! Hmm…
2.9B views? That' so many!
Nostalgia 🫶🏻
"Repeat stuff, repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff!"

Justin Bieber am your biggest fan can you say my name Aarshi
"Guys, try listening to Rauf&Faik.They are Russian pop duet of Azerbaijani origins, formed by twin brothers Rauf and faik Mirzaev Most of their songs sound amazing 👏 because their voices and music are incredible! The way they sing touches my heart. am very hypnotised by their songs, and since started listening to them, became fan of Russian music. Trust me, if you listen to them wholeheartedly, you will definitely become big fan of them! And it' sad 😥 that many people don' know those talented and adorable fraternal twins. They are available on all other platforms. :) am genuinely ❤️ the talented and adorable fraternal twins Rauf&Faik 😍 ❤❤❤"

"nostalgia hit all of sudden. was 12 when this came out and was 13 when heard it first as first time ever got an internet at home, old pc pentium 4, an internet with the speed of 320p, summer of 2011, the days are never coming back.. its like growing up with this song and almost being the same age right now JB would be. still cannot pick up proper lyrics but back in the days it was all the accent and sounding as if really knew the lyrics, cringing siblings all over singing this song but it was the era of cool days, emo time as well.. to be honest 2008-2013, five best years, its like life stopped right there. cannot even function liken the same"

"awkward confession but listened to this when was 7 and one of the top comments was ""this song is so bad it gave me cancer"" and was like fresh out the womb still had afterbirth on me and all. so believed the comment and refused to listen to this song for 3 years before realized songs actually could not give ear cancer yknow contrary to popular belief. feel as if have missed out on crucial part of 2000s baby childhood. hate you AngelOfDarkness249."
"On the night of June 1, Russia launched missile attack on Kyiv. As result, three people died in the Desnyan district of the capital: 9-year-old girl, her 34-year-old mother and 33-year-old woman.

"Why this song feels just like The Temptations - Lady Soul in slowed down tempo. Including on the ""ohhwooh ohh"" intro, he only changed the last humm of the variation then copied and pasted it as it is. Mara re homotše"
"Why did you delete my picture from the clip, my son, Justin? Don' you want your father to appear with you?!!!"
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
"feel like this song has so many dislikes from people who were young when this came out, had their heart broken, got reality check, went through some life and came back to this song and cringed to death over the fact that, it basically is what it is at face value, young first heartbreak...for KIDS, like it literally can' grow up with you, like WE KNOW wassup now, so to come back and reminisce on our first heartbreak and how much they ODed on playing this over and over and over again on the radio, people hurried up and disliked it....on top of it being trend to just do it too lmao."

Omg his voice is so high 😂😂 my classmate has thought he was girl Good Job Justin Bieber wonderful song
You do have terrible voice Justin.
miss this song
"This song is no worse than many others. What still find tremendously embarrassing is the music video. Truly cringeworthy. No wonder it has reached record of dislikes. Justin looks really ridiculous, living meme, he looks like he was made on purpose to be trolled. Unbelievable that he has managed to become such an established and especially appreciated artist."

drakes in this video
best song ❤️ never stop listening ❤❤
Sound is music because life and beauty are one. The hate this song got was not right and due to ignorance. do not listen to this often but recognize that this to is beauty normally listen to old hippie music ' not super old though. But people don' really love music in this world. Only enlightened people who realize sound is music. It doesn' mean to love sound you want to hear anything but you recognize at least and give total love and credit to all artists. Even the bird in the tree in the morning.
👏👏👏👏👏

[......... ] Bab baby, baby oh, oh, .... like baby, baby, baby no, no, .... like baby, baby, baby, oh, oh, .... Thought you’ always be mine, mine (xx) [Ludacris] Lud , When was thirteen had my first love, There was nobody that compared to my baby, And nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above, She had me going crazy, oh was star-struck, She woke me up daily, don’ need no Starbucks, She made my heart pound, skip beat when see her in the street and, At school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend"

"YOU HAVE QUESTIONS? HAVE ANSWERS!!--Death and murder increasing! ...LAWS are made to protect people and increase or maintain quality of life for humans.. There is growing REBELLIOUS trend to TRASH laws, including moral ones, as mentioned in the bible. 99% of preachers don' even support ALL 10 commandments, and many don' support even any by their LAWLESS heresy. CRIME & CLERGY CONNECTION = TRICKLE DOWN IMMORALITY.. ""When people’ thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God’ law and really are not even able to obey God’ law."" ROMANS 8:7 Society will increasingly SUFFER! The barbarians are coming, the barbarians are coming...!!! The preachers lead the charge!! ""My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, will also reject you, that you shall be no PRIEST to me: seeing you have forgotten the LAW of your God, will also forget your children.” Hos 4:6 Christianity is mostly now populated by GULLIBLE , DECEIVED, FANATIC VICTIMS who have never read even the whole new testament once. They spend almost ALL of their weekly waking minutes (6720) influenced by perverted , depraved worldly culture and , if they attend church, learn bunch of ambiguous, abstract, obscure, religious lingo & cliches for teaching by inept preachers who are deceived modern, law trashing, bible warping Pharisees.

"’ve always said Justin Bieber was treated badly by the media. He’ far more talented than lot of people give him credit for. And sure he went through ""jerk"" faze, but not any more or less than most teenagers and young adults. At least he’ admitted to them and has grown up. Lol, rant over."

nostalgia
"Listening again to this music in March 30, 2023 after so many years."
I Do Not Know why people hate this song. like this song so much. 😗
Miss the days where everyone was talking about this
"Sure is better than ""First Girlfriend"""
!
was 5 when this came out and still remember listening to it when was very young. I Am 18 now and still listen to it
"Personally think the speaker could have defended her case bit more respectfully, but in the end she is right. The womb does show just how different men and woman are truly as humans. mean, one can get pregnant one can', one' private is hole and one' stick, one is naturally stronger and one' weaker, etc, etc. Also, even transgender people know that penis or vagina' so important to gender that you are not even considered different gender til have the surgery which still doesn' truly define transsexuals gender because it' not natural and if man loses his penis from shark attack then he' absolutely no less of man though would hate life after that, but anyways, even after surgery, having part of another beings body that was not from does not make man. For example, some people get pig organ transplants, but should we call them pig hybrid since are whatever connect to urself and if that were the case then transgenders should just identify as per man part woman since losing you are worm or black hole doesn' take away you are male or female arms, legs, stomach, chest, etc and anyone can go by whatever they want, but it should not be policy for everyone else to play these games. We have freedom of speech and it should not stop for some bull crap"

Let be honest he made this masterpiece in the age of 15. He is born talented.
This song is really bad to be honest…(my opinions)
"' leaving this comment here so after months or years when someone likes it, get reminded this song♥️"
did anyone notice that drake is on this video 😳
Justin Bieber my big sister is fall in love with you!! 🤩🤩
This song that to another world if we imagine carefully we said that the owner of that world is Justin Bieber but important thing is that it' take me in childhood on that the katy perry Taylor Swift selena gomez all American stars grew the American music industry and make very strong and popular songs like baby roar you belong to me every American artist and Canadian artist take his music industry beyond the level
If you love Justin Bieber then like here👇
"justin bieber so stupid, he says baby to girl when baby is actually referring to new born child."
"Justin... You shone brighter than all the lights in the world , you shone like the sun , don ' understand why you went out 💔😔"
Good night love your song
He brings the music ain' gon lie×3
Justin Bieber 💔🔪🔥
The girl look alike selena

"Crazy what reputation can do to song. You pry away all the negative attention, and you got catchy, quality pop song."
stop do not say that
The We yg
You suck because my name is Justin and people keeps calling me that at school so stop
we are getting so old omg so depressing
"always hated this music (and haircut) with passion. ' from the generation before and was raised on rock and metal. But stand with Corey Taylor that, like him or not, he really was great performer and an incredible dancer at such young age. It' too bad that they really didn' show off what he can really do as much as they should. also respect that he learned dancing from watching Michael Jackson. And can' hate anybody who loves MJ that much."
"Justin seems to have made lot of people jealous and angry with him because he is the master of this pop, and love it! Because there is no success without haters"
heard this song in last year check out Luigi426s channel
"love this song Justin might hit 100M in the future, this is for you Justin"
Steel this song always in hearts amazing memories of JB king of looks and voice
remembering great legends :)

This song lives in my head rent free
@Justin Bieber how many dislikes does this video have?????
This song is absolute swag!
#justinbieber the least you can do is look into the marine algae injection that stops the spread of the disease to other parts of your body. So the penicillin shock process actually kills the problem. ' sure you have also looked into these things. Some people are born with it from what hear so can' judge.
It' been 13 years but still felt like yesterday. What good old day' baby
We love Justin Bieber
❤❤❤❤still love this song 🎵
Show me guys how frequently you visit here. Gave 👍 every time.

2.9 billion views how many crushes did this guy have ? How MANY
You have girlfriend
still see your channel right now because these two songs are trending now in 2023 and was listening to love you Justin Bieber
Let' be honest... Who all are still attached with this masterpiece ❤️❤️
iam waching this in 2023 latest
"listen in 2012 for the frist time, and listing in 2023 gain"
Got To respect Justin. At this age he had millions of people mostly his age telling him to off himself because it was the “cool” “funny” thing to do back in the day and he didn’ let it get to him. Sure he’ not the perfect human but man he made something of himself
Miss this moment
Ha fashioned compulsion to avoid people who enjoy this stuff so as not to corrupt it. It' fairly enjoyable as 30 year old dude in 2023.
This song is very good
All the background girls resemble Selena his one true love
"Ok ik ’ 17 , but just want to live this age 13 years ago when this song showed up"
Ok SONG LOVE FOREVER #JUSTINBEIBER

13 years later and this song hasn' aged day. It still sucks just as bad as when it was first released.
Time when love was not joke...
danced to this song when was 5 years old
saw the drake
am from India and love Justin Bieber
This song helped me in writing letter to my girlfriend 🙂
"It' crazy and sad how he got bullied and received death threats over this song for years as child. Now that ' an adult, ' realizing how all of this and the pressure from the internet saying he isn' ""man enough"" led to him doing bad choices as he was growing up."
Advanced Happy Birthday Justin Bieber you turned 29 this year. ❤❤❤❤

"This was like the first song that gave me this kind of Calm Down by Rema or Jolie by Khaid vibes. If you guys get me, like when you are trying to talk to this girl you like but she’ giving you mixed signals or she’ like trying to be disinterested and you are like saying she should just accept you because you just can’ get her out of your mind even when she says no, you tell her you are never going to love again, because she was different from all the other girls in your past, like you get my view?😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😎😎😎🤩🤩🤩🤩"

The song keep hearing when was in secondary school every single day when this song was released out into the world haha
Imagine if he sang this for Hailey...
Awesome song
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"The main reason why this song has an insane amount of dislikes is more likely to be from the fact that it’ by Justin Bieber and not the song itself, the song itself while wouldn’ call it bad it definitely isn’ good, feel like this song was disliked mainly by Justin Bieber haters which isn’ too surprising when considering that he is one of if not the most controversial singers in history"
"Despite this song being hated by almost everyone including myself, you got to admit that this guy sang really well consider the fact that he was only 15 at the time of making this song"
love you and sing

"If you are here, you are an old man like am."

2023 but still here
This song is evergreen
"did my own experiment one time, have smaller weak chin/jawline and so started punching my jawline to try and toughen up my look and realized the blood swelled up on the chin and had bigger looking jawline .. the crazy part is for the next few hours remember have conversation with someone and they treated me so much differently.. they kept carrying on the conversation and then really listening to me when spoke. couldn' believe it. never did that again but should have got chin implant because that' what improves your appearance the most most. My social experiment confirmed what always thought which is most people want to feel better about themselves by associating themselves with more attractive people."
Its bean 12 years but still its the best song and. Always stay in our heart/mind
Love from India 🇮🇳
Baby baby baby baby OHHHHH

The song is suck but we see our memories
"🧭🧭When you go to the other side, there' no turning back;⤴ you will have to give an account of everything you did😨🥺 or didn' do while you were alive. Didn' you want to avoid sin, didn' you want to accept Jesus✝ in your life? This will weigh heavily on your judgment!😵💫😵 Come to Jesus, attend an evangelical church, read the bible for you to know the commandments you have to practice. Jesus died for all of us, he did his part, he won, and he rose again on the third day. Will you come, will you do his part? He is talking to you now; tomorrow may be too late for you, he is waiting for you.🛐 Hugs!💋💛💙"

feb 2023 and the king JB still owns youtube
"just don’ see what is wrong and so bad about wanting to give good looking girl some love, ( love making ) people laugh at me because of that ,and many girls really hurt me by calling me ugly when it’ not my fault and were so mean to me, ( You Can’ Really Trust People ), mean ,look what those Serbs have done in Bosnia during that aggression ,thousands of Bosniak women and young girls were RAPED in such brutal ways and get this hate,why does God allow all of this?? They got pleasure , can also buddy.(❤️✌️👍)."
"think of my kids with this song. My ex wife took them away from me and the court believed her story. Come back to me, babies"
😄😄😄😄😄😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😜😜😆😆😆😃😃😃
Justin biber rocks
Very good song
THIS MASTERPIECE NEVER GETTING OLD🥰❤️💯❤️
Brooooo mean he slayed😭💗
Legends see this real video in 2023 🥰
Song so good 🥰🥰
Baby baby baby no please don' do these dance moves anymore
The dance moves are so bad though like no that is not ok like seriously
He rolls on table #usless
She doesn' want fucking ring she want to leave her alone
Don' touch her man
What up with the heart thing
Like this should be elegale
Bro just stop
Bro she' running away
He goes in to kiss her right after she said
What up with his moves like #cring
He latterly pulls her shirt so technically he is harassing her
He is such show off at bowling
Nice song supr
"Initially like many others despised this song so much but later realised how nostalgic it is. much simpler time, school, and hanging out playing games together with my friends. No adult life bs, responsibilities, work, and loneliness. YouTube truly is the closest to an easy access time machine."
did know drake on the video clip back then? watch 1:14
this is song is soo good 👍👍
love justin Bieber
made me sad my girl broke up with me yesterday
Baby Justin looks like Stephen SALVATORE from vampire diaries ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
"(Luda) When was thirteen, had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was starstruck She woke me up daily, don' need no Starbucks (Woo) She made my heart pound, and skip beat when see her in the street and At school on the playground, but really want to see her on the weekend She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazin' And now my heart is breakin', but just keep on sayin'"

"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. (Joel 2:12-13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)"

Where is drake?
Me. Forever will too.
Go to join BTS
This song is very nice and nice voice
"Every time think of Justin Bieber, the song attached to his name is this song ""Baby"" lol. think this song catapulted his fame. 🤩"
Why does he sound more like girl than me?
My Masterpiece “girl don’ want but boy want”
remember the days playing modern warfare 2 after school with the boys on Xbox 360. With the front door wide open on hot summer day with the cool air nicely blowing trough the windows and front door with baby playing at full blast. The good old days. No stress no heartbreak no problems. Now the world is the enemy. ’ so pleased that Justin as finally started been much more faithful too our Heavenly Father. really got sick of his BS and hated him at one point. But now he’ true brother grown into real man. And regenerated my upmost respect thank goodness he got himself onto the right path. We all need to hit rock bottom to build foundation Hallelujah Justin 👏🏻🙏🏻
Oh😍
the hate really was unwarranted this is good vibes all around
BUENA MUSICA BABY JUSTIN BIEBER LO AMO MUCHO

Listening this masterpiece for the 1st time in 2023😃
"This song is one of my favourite, but didn' understand why it was given so much dislike before remove of dislike"
Sold for 200milly damn justin

Today listners
Justin sold his music rights for 200 million. Even this song is worth 100 million lol
"Time flies 😢 when was young alway listen to this song. Now ' old 🥺 it bring me back to 2010, ilysm Justin ❤"
2:21
am Indian like this song so very much
"Okay, YouTube recommended this to me out of the blue, 've never felt so weird about how drastically my music tastes have changed-💀"
remember this was one of the first memes saw back in 2000' YT along with trollface
as much as i am embarrased to admit it this song is banger edit no its not wtf was on when wrote this 💀
Drake cameo is crazy he been that guy fr 🔥🔥🔥
Came here because of Tekashi 69 wtf is wrong with Ludacris this was the most 😑 ever
Baby 💗
"Justin Bieber. Low talent. Juvenile delinquent. Cheesy millennial music played by music boxes/drum kits/computers/etc. Crappy lyrics. Little kiddy video . Awful is not nearly expressive enough, yet below are tons of morons RAVING about how much they love & adore this meaningless garbage. And this worthless puke just sold his rights to all 290 (who knew) of his previous songs for $200M. Guess he is not worthless. His music sure is."
White shirt girl attracted me ❤️
It' not just song.... It' the emotion of every teenager ❤❤❤❤

"Even if it reaches one soul it is of great joy. God Almighty has been revealed through his son Yeshua in hebrew ( Jesus ). Jesus is the final authority. He is the way the truth and the life. We are all born sinners. That Is why Jesus being perfect died on the cross for our sins. Jesus said there will come many after him saying they are the one. Do not listen to them. When it comes to other religions there is no other way to heaven but through Jesus. Jesus will also be the Judge of Mankind at the end of the Age.. His greatest commandments are as follows love the Lord thy God with all your strength mind and soul. The second love your neighbour as yourself. If you truely seek God you will find Yeshua ( Jesus ). It does not matter which country religion backround familly you are born in the best thing one person can do is turn from evil and accept him as your Lord and Saviour. God bless Jesus' message as He began His ministry: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel John 8:58 “Very truly tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, am!” Matthew 16:16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” John 11:25 Jesus said to her, “ am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die Matthew 24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

"It is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment. Hebrews 9:27 WEB For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 WEB But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 WEB For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:16 WEB Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 WEB Jesus answered, Most certainly tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’ enter into God’ Kingdom. John 3:5 WEB For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God. Romans 8:14 WEB One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’ see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 WEB Don’ be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever man sows, that he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 WEB Who will pay back to everyone according to their works: to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; but to those who are self-seeking, and don’ obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation. Romans 2:6-8 WEB For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins. Hebrews 10:26 WEB For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, And tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, And then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame. Hebrews 6:4-6 WEB Enter in by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter in by it. How the gate is narrow and the way is restricted that leads to life! There are who find it. Matthew 7:13-14 WEB But as it is written, Things which an eye didn’ see, and an ear didn’ hear, which didn’ enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9 WEB This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 WEB"

hello people wanted to say how God is good God loves you so much that he died on the cross for you so that we could go to Heaven with him as long as we repent our sins and spread the gospel. His faithfulness doesn' stop their though he also lead the Isreal slaves out of Egypt and kept them safe and protected He is also slow to anger and even then his anger doesn' last long. am not ashamed to say that praise mighty God like him God who loves me and God who cares about me and God who comforts me and who helps me.Jesus loves you so much that he died on the cross for you so that you can have eternal life with him so please repent and spread the word of God Seek the Lord while you can find him. Call on him now while he is near.

"It is absurd and makes no sense to try to have an income of $500-$5000 within 2-3days or week of investing or trading but it is possible over some time to make as much as $12000-$35000 in an interval of 6months-1year. If you think about it the other way as being easy. Trades involve risks or mistakes like any other profession in life like Amazon, eBay, FedEx, Apple American auto-shipping, Mountway auto transport, and Nexus Auto transport. These are professionals and experts who involve in the trade of production, manufacturing, and service delivery to the customers at times the product gets damaged and has to be replaced with another one by the companies. It won' be possible to ship these services or involve in the trade as an individual considering the factors in place of the kind of trade you want to make. In time-investing professions like Engineering, and medicine. An amount of time is required to get the job done like car, aircraft, missile, train manufacturing, surgery, and medication. have seen schemes parading on YouTube Facebook, and Instagram claiming to make profit of $2000-$7000 within 2-3days trading or investing, ignoring the fact that trade is complex algorithm programmed to make customers lose or gain little even though the experts who claim to make such post or article look as real as possible, see such post as fraud. scammers and rippers.

In the crowd of years, year after year passes, and every year there are facts and dreams, and my dream is to see you well every year. Today' sun shone with smile, promising new day. Happy new year."

She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo Like baby, baby, baby oooh thought you’ always be mine… ’ gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah) Now ’ all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah…) Now ’ all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah…) Now ’ all gone (gone, gone, gone…) ’ gone… Read Full Lyrics at iLyricsHub:"

"This song is regarded by some as the worst song of the decade. Do agree? Not really. Though the autotune is overly abundant, the vocals are lacking, and the techno instrumental is very dated, there are some aspects to this song that like: For one thing, like the melody during the opening, and the percussion aspects to the song are somewhat catchy."
am this song is good!

"Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh. You know you love me, know you care, Just shout whenever and will be there. You are my love, you are my heart and we will never ever ever be apart. Are we an item? girl quit playing, we are just friends, what are you saying. Said there’ another, look right in my eyes, my first love broke my heart for the first time. And was like… [Chorus] Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine (repeat) Oh, for you would have done whatever, and just can’ believe we are not together and want to play it cool, but ’ losing you will buy you anything, will buy you any ring, And ’ in pieces, baby fix me and you shake me til’ you wake me from this bad dream. ’ going down down down down and just can’ believe my first love won’ be around. And ’ like… [Chorus] [Ludacris] Luda, When was 13 had my first love, there was nobody that compared to my baby and nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh was star-struck,she woke me up daily, don’ need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound, skip beat when see her in the street and at school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend. She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying…. [Chorus] Now ’ gone, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now ’ all gone. Gone, gone, gone, gone, ’ gone."

This is my favorite song.
"You know you love me, know you care, you shout whenever and will be there. You are my love, you are my heart and we will never ever ever be apart. Are we an item? girl quit playing, we are just friends, what are you saying. Said there’ another, look right in my eyes, my first love broke my heart for the first time. And was like… Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine. Oh, for you would have done whatever, and just can’ believe we are not together and want to play it cool the thought of losing you buy you anything, buy you any ring, and now please say baby fix me and you shake me til’ you wake me from this bad dream. ’ going down down down down and just can’ believe my first love won’ be around. And ’ like… Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine. Luda, When was 13 had my first love, there was nobody that compared to my baby and nobody came between us, No-one could ever come above She had me going crazy, Oh was star-struck, She woke me up daily, Don’ need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound, skip beat when see her in the street and At school on the playground But really want to see her on the weekend. She knows she got me dazing Coz she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking But just keep on saying…. Baby, baby, baby oooooh, like baby, baby, baby noooooooo, like baby, baby, baby, ooooh. Thought you’ always be mine, mine. Now ’ gone, now ’ all gone. Gone, gone, gone, gone, ’ gone."

🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
This is really good
never get my self together when listen to this song and he was young too and he sounds amazing
this song is trash
my big brother Louis is born in 2008 just few few years before this song came out and was born in 2014 that means was born after this song came out
"Ludacris had nothing to add to this song. In my opinion Ludacris' passage is the only boring part of this song. Nowadays white Americans seem to bow and scrape before their former slaves; either they eagerly lick the sweat out of black men' armpits or, in police uniform, gun them down for target practice. And they don' seem to see the massive contradiction in this."
' 12 years old
Seriously: how many guys secretly fancy him??.. like me..
Gorgeous ❤
JK
embarrassed and my sister our mom took video of us singing along and sent it to our aunt so suck Justin!

All For Last 12 Years
He sounds like woman

"ever since was kid, that little jacket tug had always made me feel something"
Who still listening to this in 2022
This song is kind of trash to be honest
You are my favorite celeberty
The song is okay but it' not for me 😂
Song will never get old😭
2022🔥
This song can' get out of my playlist for 12 years
"Can we all agree that despite all the negativity, this song really is legendary?"
"justin in his prime, the best, all of this is in the past but 2010 jb never left me"
And still❤
Justin needed cool haircut because this ain' it
Love your music so much. Thanks for sharing your good vibes to every one.
"am crying to the thought of the fact that one day he will be sold enough to get rest from singing and new singers will come and or we will all be like , when was little justin beiber used to be great singer, it' just das to think about"
JB❤️
💃🏽✨baby✨💃🏽
BEM LEGAL
It' really not that bad. Even though ' not Justin Bieber fan.
We just friends
It has been twelve years since this song came out and Justin Bieber was bowling with his friends and wow! wish can have my baby at the bowling alley dancing with me. Ludacris kills this verse and he sure can rap very fast. Justin Bieber and Ludacris should do another collaboration one of these days when they get together. Drake makes cameo in this music video and he sure knows how to become the life of the party.
"oh yeah, shit"
not my type of music but that is world class voice
was only 7 when he sang this song
'
Still in fire 2022❤

Justin ìs legendary singer but the the main part of this song is music and the writer of this song who create this legendary song guess after 100 year this song gona be still same vibe like as now we should thankful the team who make this songs
Unpopular opinion.. still listen to this one for the Ludacris part.
"Justin Bieber is the best example of god' grace and gifted child... Hardwork, dedication, luck factors doesn' come into account in case of Justin Bieber"
hate Justin.... But came just because my girlfriend is his fan
ohh baby anybody in november..
Best song ever love from India🫶❤️‍🔥
We Are In 2022 But The Song Didn’ Become Old And Endless Craze For The Song ❤
Ludacris interested line when was 13 had my first love.. hardly few people in the world could make it up@13

When was 13, had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody come between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was star struck She woke me up daily, don' need no starbucks She made my heart pound, it skipped beat when see her in the street and at school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend She knows she got me dazing because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying... Baby baby baby oooh Like baby baby baby nooo Like baby baby baby oooh Though you are always mine mine Baby baby baby oooh Like baby baby baby nooo Like baby baby baby oooh Though you are always be mine mine ' gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah) Now ' all gone (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) Now ' all gone (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) Now ' all gone"

Girl, quit playing We are just friends, what are you saying? Said there' another and looked right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time And was like...

"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; man with brown eyebrows, beard, mohawk, and golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding hog. Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in push. At the same time, he can also function as tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent' hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender' part, though be wary of spells. Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter' splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent' go-to counter is swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn' very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not good idea to send in Hog Rider simply to destroy building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King' Tower. If Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent' card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider' health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent' side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have smaller hitbox than passive building, which means if that if defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent' side, Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’ landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind tank in large push. Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player' King' Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be method of mitigating all damage dealt to Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King' Tower' health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of back door three crown. better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. Hog Rider combined with Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent' defenses thin. However, building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both swarm bait and damage combo. It is very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with swarm. If this happens, use spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini ..... combo. Both units are fast but the Mini ..... does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini ..... can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent' deck if they happen to react to him fast enough."

Imagine watching this in 2022
"Sidhu Musewala was just ten months older than Justin Beaver but Justin Beaver' career started much earlier in 2008 and Sidhu' career started in 2017 and ended in 2022 Sidhu Musewala' on 29/5/22was shot and killed. But by rising from small village, what he achieved in five years, it is not just matter of everyone, looking at his popularity, then by 2030, everyone will come to No.1 in the whole world.Would have been favorite singer but alas it could not happen. God rest his soul"

"Hey, Jesus loves you! He already died on that cross for you, with the biggest act of love, making possible the impossible, and he will always be by your side. “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel”, as Mark 1:15 says. Jesus is the only path to the father, where are you going to address? Either heaven or hell? Are you addressing to an eternal life with God or an eternal life separated from him in suffering?."

timeless hit 💓jb
"Justin is 3 in half years older than me and remember when was 13, was 130 pounds and their was this magazine cover that said that he only weighed 108 pounds. literally hated myself for being younger and weighing more than him. That magazine cover might have been lie but still, somehow remember this. He used to be probably the most hated man on the planet back then think it was out of pure jealousy due to how famous he was and how every girl loved him. He was so famous so young and it’ sad how lot of the people around him were influencing him badly and he grew up way too fast. Of course he made the decisions he did so he has to take responsibility for it but the industry really put him through lot. just hope he’ truly happier now."
Ohh look at young Drake 🤣
12 years pass still masterpiece
he was handsome 12 years ago

"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:7) Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. (Joel 2:12-13)"

"For it will be like man going on journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master' money. Now after long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, have made five talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over little; will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, have made two talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over little; will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, knew you to be hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, So was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that reap where have not sown and gather where scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ Matthew 25:14-30 ESV"

"remember everyone was disliking this video because of Justin' shitty behavior back then Just like his lyrics in ""lonely"" say, he really was an idiot kid. ' glad people have forgiven him. Actions speak louder than words and do think Justin has changed into better person, something that lot of people sadly never do."
"This song was released when was 2 years old, now am 14 but still listening this song... Best song 💜"
Who' here in 2022???

Let' see how many of you still dislike this song
"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment. Hebrews 9:27 ESV For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 ESV But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 ESV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 ESV Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 ESV Truly, truly, say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 ESV For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:14 ESV Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 ESV Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Galatians 6:7 ESV For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins Hebrews 10:26 ESV Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. Matthew 7:13-14 ESV What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him 1 Corinthians 2:9 ESV And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 ESV"

"It is reserved for men to die once, and after this—judgment. Hebrews 9:27 LSV And God commends His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ died for us; Romans 5:8 LSV For God so loved the world that He gave the only begotten Son, that everyone who is believing in Him may not perish, but may have continuous life. John 3:16 LSV Convert, and each of you be immersed on the Name of Jesus Christ, for forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 LSV Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, say to you, if anyone may not be born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the Kingdom of God. John 3:5 LSV For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God; Romans 8:14 LSV He who is believing in the Son has continuous life; and he who is not believing the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 LSV Do not be led astray: God is not mocked; for what man may sow—that he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 LSV For if we are sinning willingly after receiving the full knowledge of the truth—there remains no more sacrifice for sins. Hebrews 10:26 LSV Go in through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it; how narrow is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to life, and few are those finding it! Matthew 7:13-14 LSV “What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and on the heart of man did not come up, what God prepared for those loving Him” 1 Corinthians 2:9 LSV And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world, for testimony to all the nations; and then will the end arrive. Matthew 24:14 LSV"

"How to be saved and be right with God for eternal life! 1-Admit you are sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God. 2-Believe onto Jesus Christ,who being the begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as free gift. 3-Confess onto God,asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start new life being born again after being saved from your sins. Scripture links below. The romans road to salvation. 1.Romans 3:10, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"" 2.Romans 3:23, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” 3.Romans 5:8, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" 4.Romans 5:12 “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:"" 5.Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” 6.Romans 10:9, “That is thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 7.Romans 10:13, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. More scripture. John 3:16-17 16.""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” 17.”For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” Romans 5:8-9 8.""But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."" 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, 1.""Moreover, brethren, declare unto you the gospel which preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3.""For delivered unto you first of all that which also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”"

"When this song first came out, was in middle school and friend had convinced me to write horrible, hater comment on this music video. Justin Bieber suffered lot throughout his stardom. My adding to the online hatred didn' help and regret subcumming to the peer pressure of hating on him, questioning his sexuality and purpose for living. ' really sorry JB! Nothing but peaceful respect from here on out. Stars suffer so much in the spotlight, and you know what, they are humans like us and should not be ridiculed."

"Trust in Jesus, Hell is real and eternal! This is what the Bible says about it.. ""The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13: 41-42 Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven "" am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me."" John 14:6 Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU ARE SINNER. We have all broken God' laws and ten commandments.. ""Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God' name in vain..""(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, ""God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. ""But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and the lake of fire, “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever and they have no rest day and night” Rev 14:11 ""For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings. Read the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!"

' in love with this song (2022)
09-2022 🕊 So Much Memories
"remember the feeling of listening to this hymn 12 years ago, the feeling of closing your eyes and feeling that butterflies in the belly of the first unrequited love, of being happy with little, of being able to stay on the street without being in danger, of friends who are gone over the years, from the posts collected from justin, from the clips that artists released at that time. time that was too good, it seems that it will never go back to the way it was before, it' just rant. the songs had lyrics and the artists were successful for having beautiful voice. Nowadays anyone seems to be successful just by making song that you can dance to in tikoteco lol This song by justin reminds me of several moments in my life! Even watching on TV loved watching you justin on rock in rio, Brazilians love you!"
've always hated this song and always will.

"This was very contagious earworm when it first came out, but then it became so overplayed it turned into 7th grade culture war of which girl hated the song more... but we all started dancing when the DJ would put it on during the school dance anyway! only know this song and maybe 2 more, but it has special place in my heart because it really captures that innocent and cutely naive feeling of childhood crushes and having your heart broken for the first time. When you are older it' like an old dream but younger you thought it was the end of the world. 🤭 don' normally ramble in music video comments but this song is so nostalgic to me now."
Now Free Fire character

🙋 hello JB
Godjob
19th of august 2022 let’ see how many people are still watching this master piece 👌👏
12 years past since this song released... But still the amount of dopamine it releases >>>>>
baby3x ohhh
Want Indian Version
"It is cringe to hell now watch it, then start to realize the first time watched this mv, bit older than JB, thought this is great mv, then as grew older, mocked JB with my friends, because they all did so. Until today never understood why should be laughed at the kids who were crazy about him. grew up and made others opinions become my own taste, ’ sure some tastes like this one will not change until die. now come to realize after watching this video, made solid step toward my end."
This song and “Clover Cage - Falling For Free” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. just want to send love to everyone and want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together.. love you ❤️
Back this after 12 years...
WWWWWW BADDIE
cannot believe 16 year old did this
"When was kid and this song first came out, and used to listen to it multiple times day. Where did those days went?"
Ft elvin music
12 year ago but still love this song🙂
so its ok to say racist things and be racist just like Justin Bieber as long as black business mans company owns your contacts and as performer your worth millions...so the real truth is hypocrite business men come in all colors and money is more important then stopping racism...
"My favourite singers - Justin , Alan, marshmello and ariana 🔥"

Is his love interest in this video supposed to look like Selena Gomez?
"do not like this song but voice is great. want that time again where this song was playing in every small store to big market. Evey mobile user was listening this song even they were walking. This kid was legend but he doesn' have any good music means songs without bad words till 2022. His hit was sorry, what do you mean, peaches, stay, am the one, love yourself but not good enough. Peaches was beautiful song but word like weed and other made unusual for everyone. He need to make those songs which will destroy music industry. This song wasn' no. 1 song in us hot 100 but was listened in every corner of this world."
love you
In this song my crush kiss my chick' until now never forget 🥺 and now his marriage to other but now have New boyfriend ☺️

"Looking back at it now, this song wasn' so bad. don' think ' ever feel like pulling it up and listening to it, it isn' really my kind of music. But there' nothing extremely terrible about it like everybody used to say. It was just thing where it was cool to hate the song."
This is why they have removed that dislike button..

When was 5 years old use to listen it has passed 12 years now am 17.
"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment Hebrews 9:27 ESV But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 ESV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 ESV Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 ESV Truly, truly, say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 ESV For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Romans 8:14 ESV Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 ESV Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Galatians 6:7 ESV For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins Hebrews 10:26 ESV Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. Matthew 7:13-14 ESV What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him 1 Corinthians 2:9 ESV"
Me as an adult understanding the lyrics is about losing someone you loved.

No The Chimera Seeks Friend” — MTV’ Teen Wolf. And or He’ fulfilment Centre For Online Businesses. Maybe should start an online business. Not Shit. should start with proof reading first. ’ interested in learning what BTM’ Are. And hence as such may start my ATM Academy Journey. I Have got greater gasp on the accounting. The House Marketing is about to start fluctuating flow. You need to spray the outside of the house. And redo the cocking. Especially if the ground has shifted and it is no longer straight up attached to the floor. That way so that as you go to change clear ou the vents all the critters that were probably kept away from the what was once clogged vents do not just come running in. When you fix problem left side must equal right side before you make move. You need to have closure adn grow through the experiences. Set you systems. With Good bones. Hozier Marren Morris Song Inspo. And then life lessons. That you send back send out to people. And then whole new power of habit for the new system. The fixed system. Because before you had the broken system and that is where the muscle memory will// may go. Also remember why you left? And or why you did not want to do it before hand and account for those? New jobs will be created then. Whether that was spread to thin. Needed time to recharge. Safely. Not just physically but emotionally. That what Libra system is. Clearing the Vents system but you have got to account for that. Emotional Wealth counted like when working in retail. Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, but now the second quarter will have two functions the 2nd Quarter and as well as the semi annual sale. That Is why everyone is running business, working from home, and doing make up and having morning routines. Were preparing for the morning rush. You have to get used to learning about your home and running it like business because we have been home so much. The Lady of Proverbs. House Wife. “Run it like business” — Jay . Jigga keeps ish popping. It took while for me to get there though. Okay SO Second Quarter and as well as semi annual will need like equality and equity. And when people end shift like at cash. You balance out there till before they leave. Hence sometimes most times people leave in batches. Like batch content. Like the Tiktok trends posted on Youtube. Because you do not want to call at store closing for questions and or concerns about till closing at mid day. And so when if people are coming in and or out of your life during pandemic you may want to do some emotional closure. Even if it is quick short and sweet. What did you learn. Your good to go thank you. So that way it is not too much of culture shock going forward into the new world. mean if you are making some lifestyle changes. It’ be great to jot something is down. So that in the event of possible mud slide you have deep roots and won’ possibly fall down. Mud slide too much sweetness. Umm there is things where Most Times trees with deep roots tend to survive in the event of mud slide. Although if you can prevent the mud slide all together, “prevent is better then cure” — My Gma. But you are trying to live in this life not prevent it and nor run into all on coming danger. And so more places should just regularly have seasonal employment. Like if retail is hiring more people then that is lot of contracts, whoever does the law for those business should have more seasonal hires hired ahead of time. That is why some people do not always make it home for Christmas because they are out working late because the work piles up. So head office and Corporate should have seasonal hires. Its great for turn over. Flushing in new air. Also gives university students, paralegals step in the door. Low Risk Low reward. They get to see if they like it before doing all the work to graduate. Before fully committing to employment career path after they have acquired all the school debt. And or done all the work. Only to realize that they hate the career and or hate the way that it is done. Set up to fail and or “Built to fall apart” — Taylor Swift Out of the woods song inspo. You know how all thin people are liek sheep hearded towards Modeling like we do not really make room for them within society; yet. Like if you were tall and thin where can you get your clothes?!?! Liek for real? Like I Am like 5,4. And the clothes the pants just touch my ankles. If not fully cover them. How are tall people just shopping on the regs. Like it must be really hard. And that is not even tall and curvy; yet. Liek School can be an Emotional Everest. And its liek some places know that. And make business where you have to pass through the invitation process surpassing the Emotional Everest sometimes at the expense of your Mental Health. And then run business where you do not yet get to sample, and that sometimes they know they do not liek but liek sell it to you at full charge. And then you are stuck with the bill. Like if you need the degreee to get the job but then you need the job to continue to fund the education. By the time you graduate if you did not sell yourself or were funding by someone else, sometimes parents other times not. Then you need the job to pay off the debt and its not even if you fully like it or not. Its relying on burnt out love for affection. Like you are telling me that there is no entry level data entry jobs, that go around just more seasonally. Proofreading for parallels adn or English Lit students. Like why are University students coming back to Retail when there should be head office and or Corporate jobs that should be hiring seasonal. And then the workers are possibly overworked and or burnt out and or needing to pay for an expensive house. And or needing to buy secondary house and or condo closer to work on top of there house. If they are the fortunate ones who can afford financial aspects of the life that they are living. But the commute is taking toll on them Emotionally and or physically. But like they do not want to live in the city. They have done the hustle and bustle but yet there are not yet and corporate jobs outside of the city. But yet do not destroy from the home town aspect. And nor hometown feels and Nor home towns sky lines. And nor hometown spaciness. Like why is everything so compacted and clsuter. Who has yet to find content and is still living at with an alarming rate of abundance. Hoarders WHy do some people live with so much stuff. Just content on content on content where is the substance. Fear of branching out maybe of fear of possibly being forgotten. What good is keeping friends around if you lose yourself in the process?!?!? That Is what I Have got so far. Scorpio Season Peak Planning Season. And Team Spirit Like For Athletic Games. Sports Teams that have the best team spirit and or motivation. Or just overall all Motivation from just general sports. And then Summer Patio Season. Winter Peak Christmas Season. Libra Season Peak Closure Season. But you hire for seasonal well in advance. Or just sometimes in Advance. said what said, hope this helps. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

"heard one of Justin biebers fans killed herself because she wanted to get close to him and he didn' visit her grave or atleast send her flowers he didn' give shit but in those times back when that happened the biebs was at another stage in his life it was time when he really didn' give shit about his fans he called one of his fans whale claiming that she was fat then he called black people niggers he said Jaden what happens when you get chainsaw ""run nigger nigger nigger"". mean why is the government protecting protecting this piece of shit he doesn' deserve it he doesn' even have real talent he just says baby baby baby oh like baby baby baby no like baby baby baby no one thing comes to mind Michael Jackson "" do not have to make political Statement my music goes all around the world all around the world"". Michael you will always be the king of pop the press called you wacko jacko and mistreated you just wanted your children to live much more normal life than what you experienced your body guards turned their back on you, family wasn' close to you, and man who was supposed to be helping you ended up killing you even if you told him give me the milk or will fire you and the Dr did should have never happened You by long long shot have made mark on our world much of the like of any body we have ever seen and we should all be forever grateful for that you your music and what you sacrificed for us. You are forever supernova celebrity who is someone with immense immense celebrity status that even the politicians of your day loved you and celebrated you and your music. You are the most awarded artist of all time and you accomplished much much more thank you for always doing right by us so we can do right by you currently in life, in the Afterlife, and through your death you may not be alive but your music lives on and please do not let Justin Bieber be you because he doesn' even appreciate his fans."
This was Justin Bieber when he didn' hit puberty yet and he was 16 years old and he sounded like girl go get snapped in the afterlife like your beeners.

Just hit &, Abercrombie, basic jeans, cargo pants. no Dior no Gucci none of that marketing madness designed to make people feel better than others after having their money stolen from them. Teens in school didn’ go around showing off LV bags and Dior bracelets. No Snapchat, no instagram, no influencers. Bowling wasn’ considered nerdy. Simpler times indeed"

More than 10 years have passed, now he is also married and living happy life. we will grow old too, but JB and his songs are still fond memories of my youth"

"You really have NO recommendations at all. Not single one! play one vid, ONE VID, out of curiosity and for whole week ' forced to delete as much as can. As well, uTube only recommends videos 'VE ALREADY WATCHED from the CHANNELS already sub too. So what is the point of lying? Why does utube lie? ' curious, why do YOU LIE? Your whole platform has turned into moldy feces. It' pointless to even try and enjoy this false (according to your specs) APP. Why does your app say it' false yet continues to be available in the Google App Store (you know, that intrusive app that insists on showing me big tits). And what' with that anyway? Why stop an app, like utube to show me bunch of girl titties on Play? On top of your sick commercials that only advertise Alcohol & Gaming. You are very sick people!! Very very Sick People! americans!"

Never forget the days we made this the most disliked video of all time before YouTube rewind
hate where he came from but ' proud of how far he came
"Something people should know about is the Thomas theory. This theory posits that things perceived to be real are real in their implications. Now, TV commercials do this. Like noom. Noom seems to be on journey of success, which makes us buy it. It started off not giving much information about the app. Now, the commercials start to reveal details about how it works. This is evidence of the Illuminati. See, they feign humility. They control business this way, by faking Christian theology, like, the humble shall be exalted, so we perceive it that way. Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"
imagine being the girl he wrote this song about
#VEVOCERTIFICATE
You know it was made 12 years ago when they pull out dancer breaking it down on the floor

"And now the Biebs has come full circle. know lot of people still dislike him but don' think anyone would come out of that type of lifestyle normal. Getting that much money and fame that young is insane. You have people telling you that you are basically god and can do whatever you want and then given the money to do anything he wanted. Yeah he made some mistakes but he grew, humbled himself, and now he' settled down, married and still releasing incredible music with incredible vocals."
Auto Tuned?
cannot believe this song has 1.8 billions views less than Gangnam style and its been out two years longer 🤯

beautiful mv enjoy 🎉
've been listening to this song for the past 12 years of my life and will for the rest of my life.
"this song unfolds very _irritating_ memory of my life was coming home from school in our van. don' know how we ended up having this but my brother and were asked to sing the ""Ouhwa"" part in the beginning of this song. didi in our van was judging us. didn' remember what the exact tune of the part was, so ended up singing the end part like run instead of slowly. Then my brother sang that part with the correct tune. That didi said that my brother sang it better. was so irritated because knew that was singing it right with the tune remembered, but my brother went slightly off key accidentally few times. Like can' describe how angry felt. mean how dare she judges us without knowing anything about music and not having sense of music at all. know that sang right, just that sang the end part bit fast. Otherwise my tune was right. That day went home and asked my mother to judge us, because of course she knows music 100 times better than that didi. Ah no, 100 times 0 is 0. So should add. She judged us and gave Justin Bieber 10/10, me 9/10 and my brother an 8/10. That was both before and after listened to the real song to recall the tune. That didi just thought that just because she is older, she knows better. Haha but no. Just because you are older, doesn' mean you are better at something you have no talent in. Who is she to judge music, huh? didi done releasing my anger, may go"

"All time favorite ...coming happy tears on my eyes ,when hearing this song."
"2:13 Luda, When was 13 had my first love. There was nobody that compared to my baby and nobody came between us or could ever come above. She had me going crazy oh was star struck. She woke me up daily don' need no Starbucks. She made my heart pound and skip beat when see her in the street and at school on the playground. But really want to see her on the weekend. She know she got me dazing because she was so amazing. And now my heart is breaking. But just keep on saying"

"One day, all of us will get separated from each other. We will miss our conversations of everything and nothing, and the dreams we had. Days, months and years will pass until this contact becomes rare. One day, our children will see our pictures and ask: ""Who are these people?"" And we will smile with that invisible tears because heart is touched with strong word and you will say: ""It was them that had the best day of my life with."""

2010: Amazing Song 12 Years Later: Still An Amazing Song 😋😋
came to listen and dislike
"This video is member of the small, exclusive ""Billion Views"" club, so it' bit surprising to me that this video is also one of the most disliked videos of all time, at one point pulling the #1 slot for most disliked video (from March 2011 until it was passed up on December 13, 2018 by YouTube' own ""YouTube Rewind 2018,"" and then later by ""Baby Shark Dance"" and ""Sadak 2 Trailer"")? According to Wikipedia, it is now the #4 most disliked video with 13.51 million dislikes as of December 2021. Do that many people hate this song that much or does it have something to do with the video itself? Perhaps the choreography' similarity to Michael Jackson? Or is it as simple as silly trolls being silly trolls and doing their silly trolling, as trolls do?"
ICEๆ BABY
Is this Justin briber in this video?
love Justin Bieber❤️💞😻
Lk

"have the question ""pride, or mortified??"" here as an item, in the records of the parents here, where pride means delighted, not at all proud!! So do that now, change it to delighted, not proud, if you have parents around, who doesn' give it to you, as ""good person"" here, that you should be, and behave with too!! This is so GEEKY, we rot here!! ' looking at MTV, with Jersey Shore, and Tori Spelling!! So they brought it up, so they must know it!! So it' proud of you, no, just delighted in you, that goes here!! In all the countries too, so change that now, and understand that we don' get delighted by the other ones here, if we are Evil, or from Goodness!! So ' not delighted in an Evil person, but can be proud of it, if it eats it' ass up, and poos it out too!! That' very delightful too, and will go proud then!! That' all good to me!! So shift that on the inside, and say delighted, instead of proud!! will do that too!! So do that now, everyone here!! Thank you!! //"

The insult to the state through deep throat adeep well and that of the hiest of Patty Hurst and the search of holy grail and that of stone Mason and police station coming treason for human trafficking and drugs trafficking connected to the meeting with George Bush and the Queen of England.

So, apparently when listening to this without the audio it sounded like girl singing romantic song to another girl and that had made certain people upset. ' not 100% on this but Its believable.. Which is kind of sad when you think about it :"

"We don' look for old songs, we look for the feelings and memories they carry"
"remember when this song first came out,time flys by so fast"
heard that Steve jobs played in this song
The two police departments that were complained about is that new Orleans and Slidellzs once known Slidell Louisiana were and the censorship of writer whom caught against Al-Qaeda even from the reporting society of the news
Human trafficking is directly part of the creation process of the movie Halloween and it' connected to the Patty Hurst and the secret service and told to remember their skin
Human trafficking can be recognized through the apple computer and September 11th and trying to overthrow the company of licusfilms and that of underground of new Orleans that once existted and that of fan that once work for George Lucas and was fired because of work of Al-Qaeda.

The connection to Justin Bieber molester and the attack on September 11th and John Kennedy can be made through the country creating the COVID -19 and the newweek article of the nuclear missiles that was written by Odessa along with that of the most recent war and it' connection to George bush during story time and the war on drugs. The project deep well and that of deep throat are also connected to denial of holy Worth called money to that of the mondren world called Jesus Christ.

"got to admit, like the song, but don' like the video. Like, it doesn' make any sense. And, of course, art doesn' have to make sense, know that more than anyone, but the video feels like he' just flirting with girl at bowling alley and the girl just accepts the advances, while he' singing ""baby, baby, baby"" which can get on someone' nerve quickly"
June 24 2022
What coincidence was in 12th and today after 12years hearing this and missing my girl
Thanks justin Bieber

was that Drake? after all these yearsssss 🤦🏽‍♂️
really love all your music
12 year ago??????
"love this song, because if it wasn' for him putting in effort to try to impress the girl he likes(in this case in the movie girl with blur jacket and skinny jeans) Right when they were going to leave the bowling alley Justin sees girl catches interest and the girl is just talking with friends and he' anxiously in hurry so his buddy does handshake which indicates ""you got this man go get her!!"" So he tries to show he likes her by going out of turn and she' just like staring at him and then he gets few down and she goes she made lot and sassily walked away with smile so he follows her in his mind wow game on let' play so he chases her around the whole bowling alley and she pushes him away everytime saying she just wants to be left alone don' likke him back and love the ending it' my favorite they all dance together and she' little convienced ok maybe he' not to bad then she starts to trust him and ends up falling for him they leave holding hands. So the purpose behind this song kind of goes well with the background story so yeah just strive for what you want and actually keep the person you want you can' just give up"

This is one of my favorite songs...Why the hell of this dislikes??? Anyone can tell me??🙌
She knows me very well
She’ sending her images so that could impressed by her
She’ in Washington for on-site
She’ working in brand company but she hasn’ enough salary
She hasn’ enough salary
Say sorry to my father
How
She likes me to show his real love ❤️
love Delhi
First economy
in China 🇨🇳
USA 🇺🇸
She would like to impressed me to show her that would also like to go abroad
But she’ Engineer
She’ open minded but she lied 🤥 me about her marriage
She’ not happy with her husband
Hey baby
She doesn’ use makeup 💄
She’ supporting her friend to get marry with me coz she knows me and she described about me
Ek bandariya moti hai Jiski Shadi hogayi hai
Gandhi ji ki 3- bandariya
But she likes to show any one her faces that’ why clicked photos without masks
She’ using mask 😷 afraid with Covid
She’ very funny 😆
remember when this song was first released like it was yesterday. thought it was girl singing. know wasn' the only one. Social media wasn' nearly as widespread so it took much longer to figure crap out as kid.😂
She’ not enough smarter than me

"there was cute girl in my class during ms who remember singing part of the lyrics to this during math class while we were using class time to finish some homework. not sure if she was fan or not, she did get wisecracks at her name being similar to Justin Bieber'. And maybe some teasing for being fan? I Am not sure, ms was long time ago but dam miss it. miss the camaraderie, of my classmates. miss being able to sit back and watch my classmates' antics and fights, they made everyday full of muffled laughter that actually liked/wanted to come to school lmao. hs sucks hell."

Get well soon Justin ❤️
12 years before and after of Justin Bieber is insane
just realized that Drake is in this video
why do people suddenly start liking things they hated in the past and start calling it banger/masterpiece
Feather Bangs is still better. Feather Bangs more like beautiful pony being.
This legend made my childhood memories by this sound
Bro they got the kicks
Iove❤️💓💗💖💘💝💞💕❣️☢️❣️❤️‍🔥💜💜🖤🤍🤎❤️🧡💛💚💙gdhdsofio

"This song has changed my life, my whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. can never look at anything the same way ever again. This song represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But can. Thanks to this song have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. never came to think in the whole universe about the definition of amazing choreography that is combined with song that is both funk and poetry fusion making this song, or rather work of art, to be the best thing my ears have heard in my whole life."

Get well soon Justin Bieber😔❤
am junior high school student in Japan. ' singing this song in an English class right now. heard that Justin Bieber is going to recuperate. Get well soon.
"talked all the trash on Justin, this was hit when was in high school, was obviously just jealous person. He was never bad musician, and as far as have seen he is pretty good person as well. wish it never happened to him, however hope he can find some way to continue to live happy and fulfilled life and make great music even with the development of his Ramsey Hunt Disorder."
So good 😊
Smiley bieber will come back soon❤️❤️❤️❤️
He will come back stronger we belive in you love you biberber ❤
Justin like you 🇺🇸

"Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 This baby has just been assaulted. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 This baby has just been assaulted what you gon do? But also where did that other kid learn to do that? Where did that other kid learn that that type of behaviour was okay and or acceptable? Kids absorb behaviours like sponge when they are young. And so who is assaulting that older kid behind closed doors?!?!?? Is no one else concerned on where that slightly older kid learned to push down toddlers like 2 years old?!?!?!?!? ' call child protective services. You know how when some kids just chop the heads off of there dolls and you just send them to therapy. AND or when they play with there dolls weird like your 5 why are your dolls having sex. Wait is that doll raping the other one?!??!?!? But like you are 5 though......ummmmmm 911. This is hella suspect. Kids have no filter. In words and nor actions. And so they do not really go nowhere unattended. ""You will be judged by the fruits of your labour"" and so where the fxxk is this kid learning this from. Its usually the parents and or the daycare!??! Otherwise who has been babysitting them babies?!?!?1 Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 ' still in shock cannot believe he just did that . That baby was totally minding his own business. Dang even infants can' yet always get no peace; yet. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. Did you know that you can send an automatic message via facebook messenger?!?!?!? Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

"Some information about the condition: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is caused by the varicella-zoster virus living in the facial nerve, creating inflammation and paralysis in one side of the face. The virus can remain dormant for decades in person who has had chickenpox as child. It is treated with antivirals, and facial paralysis and hearing loss can sometimes become permanent. On March 12th, 2022, his wife Hailey Bieber suffered mini-stroke due to small hole in her heart (Patent foramen ovale, congenital heart defect) from which the clot traveled to her brain. She underwent surgery to close the hole which she said was between 12 and 13 millimeters. Wishing the best for their health."

"Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 “ Wish Things Were Different” — Halsey. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Halsey -- So Good. ""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. This is her love letter to her past self during her ghost era. She missed out and or still deeply misses past love. think it was herself "" couldn' yet do it. And or handle it, but halsey could"" For when she changed her name from Ashley to Halsey. Ash. Maybe She as like Tamar Ashened too at one point in her life!?!?!? She knows it bad but her self love could be so good. She thinks about herself and or the ghost of who she used to be almost everyday. The one that got away. When she fell and needed help getting up. And or the overall weight of the pain got to big. Does Not she have song called Ophelia. She was drowning from the heavy clothes in her deep emotional waters. do not yet fully know what heavy clothes represents emotionally though yet. But maybe she needed helping hand and the Mixtapes Gone was the way she felt she needed to do// go through it. The weight can get heavy sometimes from the life that you have lived. ""gOD will always find way for his anointed"" -- tHB. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 ""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. 0:00 Opening credits. So Good by Halsey. She' trending 13th on Friday June 10th. Maybe she is still an emotional prisoner to her past; for now. Tripple . Third lap spiritual. Opening Credits Tripple . aAA. Maybe she needs someone to call her Tow. And or Triple . Like CAA tow truck for her self in the spiritual world of District 13. Maybe. Who is the tow truck for your emotions?!?!?!? Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

"Hand in hand we walk around the roads during midnight. Under the gaze of moon we talk about our days Spending our time together, cooking and watching our best loved shows Our laughter blooms in the empty walls while chasing each other Reading our favorite poetry and books Embracing each other flaws with hugs Kissing each other pain so every tear become reason of joy. Leaning on each other during hard times And be the reason of happiness. Addicted to our mischievous adventures Flattered by the honest appreciation and The respect that never seems to be undone Becoming more powerful by being only one Our eyes become the witness of our love Telling how beautiful we are with one another🦋️❤️✨"

"12 years later its kind of weird to look back at this, it haves iconic hook, instrumental and good production. The songwriting is nothing amazing, but for song that was hated by 13 million people once this hits very better than renembered. iconic, easy to sing along and good production. Nothing to complain about it. 9,5/10"

"Yes, you. You are probably scrolling through the comments, like am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don' stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don' dwell on things from the past, don' stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, ' going to wake up tomorrow morning, hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well!"

Gmgbmjxbb.
"even though everyone has heard this song at least billion times now, justin used to ruled the fucking world"
"Ludacris singing about seeing girls on the playground wasn’ cool, even then"
This song is kind of my guilty pleasure that do not want to say to my friends
Makes you think about how much things have changed .....
Bro remember being kid and this was my favorite song for some reason would always dance and sing this lmaooo
hope this song is still out so that when we get older we can still here all his song all his songs.
So weird to see Justin look like this from 11 years ago- It' so nice to see how well he' grown these past years <3

"still remember, when this video had more dislikes than likes. Sad that dislikes are now gone😭"
Cannot stand this mf but his music is catchy af
"Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 So you can have your work friends, personal life friends, sports friends, neighbours, etc. And you can mix and match. But mostly you know who is who and which is better for if you are to want to mix and match. Adn so that it is not too messy. If your work friend choses not to help you with your hurting heart then tjhats okay that is your work friend. If they may chose to connect with you on human count yourself in as person quotient then that is great too. If they chose to help you as friend then that is an added bonus. Its not always snakes and ladders. But some work friends can get close like personal life friends and some personal life friends can drift like to an emotional distance of work friend. It happens. But more importantly it is to help you manage your emotional expectations. But also mostly so that if you need to keep your metronome and keep the beat should you lose your footing and need to reset and get your footing again and again. Then ou have other areas and boundaries emotional and otherwise and that provides that safe space to fumble that what is expected of you in those various areas. Which could help you to skateboarding should you fall. So that you don’ fall full stop which is soo not good for your heart. You want to walk it off. Always. Keep rolling. But this is so that you do not roll to far away from even you. You know. So that you don’ risk potentially losing yourself past the storm to the point where even you cannot yet recognize yourself even. And then your self care unwind natural methods are for end of the night recap. End of the night unwinding. So then you already have your life and patterns which can help you should you need to run on autopilot. You can rely on your systems and people and environments. It does not mean that you do not need to let anyone in. Its just so that if // should you get caught up in storm you can have systems CPR emotional health and safety so that you can weather the storm until yes in terms of emotional storms too “This too shall pass” ;). But having that space where you are okay within your self care. Have found home within your soul. And found comfort within your own comfort aspect of self care. have your own outlets, spaces, for not just walking but settling down and getting deeper roots within you. It can help with when you are solid who you may chose to let in, emotionally. So that you can check in with should your wold start to slip through your fingers, for minute or two. But if you have not yet find that then you may close the doors for minute and weather the storms. Liek if the clothing store is soo busy and has so much turnover and the sales and clothes and people are buying and your store is making soo much money. But the store is starting to look liek soo much of mess. And so you make the judgement call to close the store during the peak of peak super cress peak to clean up and reset and reposition every to new areas. To clean to rehydrate. To emotionally reset. Grow through the experience since it is an unprecedented peak of peaks and have people in various sections to help people with what they need in where it can get various help. People don’ more from there work spaces. If you need something use your walkie talkies and we’ send floaters to use. Back stock is in back stock. And if should it get peak christmas shopping season in June then you call in your call in’. And you call in some extras and allocate for it. And call in your back up. Call in your other managers. ANd inform head office of just what is happening. So that the communication is still flowing. So that there is communication and support. And then you can account for more health and safety. Maybe even have shopping limits for such peaks. Guage and have people at the door to gauge how many people go in before you open back up. SO that way you won’ have to close up shop during peak hours again. ANd then let people in like its club. Maybe. Either way it is to account for health and safety and LP (Lost prevention) you know. Its whole new work system but its kind of just translate work peak seasons. You know. Either way it is to protect the worker and worker staff too. Its liek if Union station and or any other train station had an early morning and or after work rush hour packed with people during liek mid day. ITs like we prepare for that but this time slot, this time frame. Its (the peak // rush of people is not usually at this time) okay we know the systems let us go. And then later check why there was so much peak. what was happening within the community that maybe was not yet accounted for to learn better for next time. Pan Am games are near by and have break around noon. The more you know. Because planes, trains and autombiles, police, restaurants, etc all prepare for when there is game in the city. YOu just already know going in ahead of time that there will be most likely will be may be alot of traffic because of game night home court game night, you know. Stuff like that. But sometimes an away game is switched to home game. But that cost money time and energy. The proper people need to be relocated enough to allocate for it. Or else huge health and safety risk and then the city might just have to shut down for the time being in order to protect the people. Everyone involved. So its really about having different environments. To simplify think of staying within your own lane as when driving on the highway. During rush hours. Bxtch do not sware. You could crash and or hit another car. And some roads are one way you cannot just haev cars in places any and any how. Like having the on coming traffic in the next lane right beside you on the collectors the person in the next lane is going west but you are on the collectors going east. YOu see how that can really fxxk you up. And so nothing wrong with wanting to be going east on the collectors on the highway, but there is lane and space for that. That being said you can switch lanes indicate. But driving during peak hours rush hours is not the same as driving late at night when there are less cars on the road. mean still be safe. But there is little more lee way when indicating and merging lanes. But still please try and say east on the east lane. aNd west on the west road. said what said. hope that helps. Anyways feel free to take country road time or two. The highway is not all there ether is in this everywhere. But maybe just in this lane, section of the road. hope you dance songs inspo. Both version. <3. hope that helps with having different sections. In terms of guarding your heart. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."
"“Be Busy Like The Wise Ant” — tHB. Also needing some different types of friends. “Lean Not On Your Own Understanding” — tHB. #RepostedPicture Via Critical Thinking. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Me Too. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Absent Friend and or also needing some different types of friends. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. You need friends with whom it is easier to communicate with. And or who just naturally understand you method of communication. You need to “Lean not on your own understanding” — tHB. And do some deep dives and or research to different// various different methods of communication. And see which method works best for you. Take few more things personally. Count yourself in as person. Do you like being here? Feeling like this? Being in this environment? Feeling the way that you are feeling within your environment? There are various ways to do anything and so why then chose to do anything in such way. Why does this way work best fr you? What about branching out and trying different ways to try things. What about seeing the bottom line? What are you doing? But does it get you? What need does it meet? What outlet do you use? What process do you go through? What ends are met by these means? And then the power of habit. Are there other ways to translate your outlets? Have your needs met in healthy, stronger, more emotionally awoken way, etc? Healthier safer? Why about trying to make room for your own little world in the real world. So that you are not always living in your head. You can read in your room. But what about branching out and reading in different rooms, places adn or environments. Nothing wrong with going to beach and or library every now and then. That being said nothing wrong with starting your own book club. Various kinds of book clubs. Just place to read quietly in room with some friends. With whom you can do your own thing inter independently. Where you can share comfortable and or proper alone time. Still safe. Still health and safety. Where you can not hide the sayings of the dark. Talk TikTok Social Media App Family Tea then. All in all make room for your own little world within the real world. It can really help you to stay present. ANd not lose your head within all your many thoughts. Also “Be Busy Like The Wise Ant” — tHB. Find your vibe. Find your tribe. Find your colony. Nothing wrong with little safe and healthy branching out every now and then. Okay and for “Go[ing all] out … to give you any help you need” — Critical Thinking Facebook Page. Maybe then try and have some safe and healthy limits. So that you don’ go too far. And risk possibly Over stretching your spirit. And or possibly going soulless. No Limit Song Inspo By Easy and Them. So maybe “Draw line before you cross it” — Eminem. Circle around where you would like to go. Know the whole limits of that space. Seen the whole 365. And then break it up into smaller more manageable sections. Like chunking. Time Chunks. Waves. Algebra. Brackets. With various things to do and then various sections. Like different classes, books, chapters, sections. And or various tasks like cleaning the house and then running errands, keeping fit, school, work, etc. What do you have to do? Maybe walk to some of your errands. And or take the car and then go on the walk after all the erands. But cleaning take energy and effort. Dishes, laundry, sweeping, etc. Sections within sections. plates with plates, cutlery, cups, soak them accordingly assembly line. And then errands what is the groove so that that works best with you too. Work within your sections. You can run your errands as you let the dishes soak. After you seperate and put load in. And or just serperate the laundry for washer. And then put them quick wash. And then pile them in the dryer. Until the load of clothes is big enough and then dry whole load of clothes all at once. ANd then you can hang up some of the other clothes while you wait. And And then while the dishes are soaking adn the laundry is being done you can already cleaned the table and swept the floor. And then you can go about your errands. You can leave the house with the laundry machine and dryer going just not the oven. If you do not want to use that time to clean the bathroom and or washrooms also. And by the time you go through all of that. After you clean the bathrooms you can take shower. And then leave the house clean. By then the laundry is done so you can spend that time folding. You can clean while in the zone and or while introspective but introspective within your house as the location has been secured. After the laundry is folded the dishes should be soaked enough adn you can wash them easily. And of if no need to soak anything. You can just clean room to room. ’ clean kitchen, bedroom, washroom, bathroom, shower and then run my errands. Most importnat ones and or the stocked up quick ones all at once. Not start with heavy and or long errand so as not to overwork myself internally. Id sleep in and wake up chill AF and then go and run that errand on my sarcathian rhythm when feel more charged up. So as not to potentially risk burn out; you know. All in all please try not to leave the house with low energy and heavy lot of thing to do. Take that big goal and break it up into smaller goals. And or feel free to invite friend and or some friends and or family members with you. You want to be energized and or half massed but enough to pay attention to your surroundings. Denying tasks, goals, obligations is not just good for your mental health and to protect your inner peace. But also for your physical and sexual pyschlogical health. So that you are least likely to be attacked because you will be energized enough to be paying attention to your surroundings and hopefully busy like the wise ant. said what said. hope this helps. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. And as for your whole heart. Find your passions interest and hobbies. Your baselines, metronomes and parent functions. Your routines. To help ground you. To help keep you solid. And then again keep your fulfilment, your speck and then get honest, with it. Go to places and people and spaces that feel like peace and bring peace to you. Diversify Diversify Diversify. You don’ need one sieze fits all for every area of your life. But it is good to be able to grow in your environments, like also able to expand, upgrade and or just branch out. “There is time for everything” — eCC, tHB. Like space for home, home away from home, school, work, library for studying after school, sports, at school away from school in sports club and or where you train away from school let people various people know where to come find you so that you can have back up in the event that should you get ambushed and or be under attack, you never know it could save your life. And then there are various friends in various areas. So that you also can have different like environments for different versions of you. Your work self, sports self, school self, proper alone time self. So that you can get to know people. And maybe even let them in. But there is way to behave in school that you do not really need to behave at home. There is way to behave at work where you don’ need to behave at// during sports. Especially if it is sports for fun and or as cathartic outlet. To let some air, energy, aggression, emotions out. But have limits there too. Sometimes its good to have deadline before you start too. So then you can not just account for your breaks. And yes have breaks. But also so that you know like potato clock when it is time to go. So that you can stay peak energy and not just drone on and on. You know help and better guard your heart, mind, spirit soul energy and vibes too. Blood of Jesus Red Too. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

Hi first time comment on here
Who is still hearing this music in 2022💥? 🤗💥
"“Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. Try Eating little Bit More Consistently. “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. When you eat on the regular food does not feel like heroine running through your veins because you have not yet eaten in such long time. But its okay in the process you can learn about snacking. Which can keep you from being over fed, in order to numb your gut instincts. The gift of fear — Book Inspo by Gavin DeBecker. “Listen To Your Tummy Buzzer” — Tiktoker. Time not wasted. Time well spent. You don’ over eat any and any where with any and anyone. It can be like getting sloppy drunk and or just getting so drunk that you pass out. Your gut instinct may be surpressed in which your tummy is breaking down sooo much food that your tummy buzzer is suppressed in which someone could use that as an opportunity to take advantage of you emotionally, spiritually, soulfully maybe even via overly sexing you out. To get access to your spirit and or soul, with and or without your permission. Some people are having really good sex. Others are spiritually and or soulfully eating up on your fulfilment bodies. Be careful. Eat before you go on date and or to hang out with friends. Some people can get you too drunk to hear your secrets to then later try adn use them against you. ANd or to tell everyone else. While others may get you too drunk to try adn take advantage of you not just emotionally, spiritually, and or soulfully but also emotionally!?!?!? If you would not tell them that when you are sober then you should not really be telling them that when you are too drunk, too full, too tired, too high, etc. If you are in no condition to actually safely drive then you should not be spilling your guts and or using the vehicle that is your body, mind, spirit, soul, brain, heart, etc. “Above all things guard your heart” — pROVERBS, tHB. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 You would not blow up every time you are not if you ate little bit more consistency on the regular. ""For it is not the letter of the law, but the fulfilment of the law"" -- Jesus debating with the Pharises. And that does just go for food your your mind and body. But food for your spirit and soul also. Are you eating your fruits of the spirit; yet? What about your vegetables of the soul? If not if you hold out too long getting love, joy peace, after such long time it can feel like crack cocaine after long time. But being desperado and really really needing food for the spirit and or body. Needing that love joy peace because its been like forever it can feel like heroine. Quite fix but its still cheap and you can tell the difference. have not actually done heroine but have felt love from someone who is desperado adn can tell you the real thing is wayyy so much better. Don' starve people to love you. An don' starve yourself until you get the love that you want. Have your limits but then translate your outlets to other appropriate outlets, like various passions interst and hobbies. But do not leave yourself starved. You know when you have not yet eaten for bit and then you get bit of meal and you thought you could go for snack but then end up eating the whole not realizing that were actually starving and that it had actually been awhile since you last ate. And that you were actually starving not just little hungry. Know that about yourself. Don' let other people take advantage of that part of you because you decide to possibly embrace ignorance in the matter. ""Do not embrace ignorance"" -- tHB. When you stop loving with your heart. And or thinking with your brain. And or trusting your gut instincts. Just like if you stoped walking for bit. And or so long. Those are all muscles. And if you do not use them then you could lose them. Your muscles could atrophy. Die off. You know that people who are anorexic, they don' actually die from not eating. They die because the body has no more food in the stomach and has exhausted all other options and then starts to eat off the muscles of the heart. Like your stomach and or just your body starts to eat your heart. And believe it or not but your body will not actually go down without fight. It really is mind over matter. ""Rage Rage Do Not Go Gently Into That Goodnight"" -- Poem. And so it is the same with your brain, it will not go down without fight. And so maybe you won' eat but your brain will// may take over and you may// will eat when you black out and go hungry. And so then it is your demons then who are feeding you. And when you black out and its like hold your breath even if you don' yet want to breath you can only hold your breath for so long and then you are going to need to inhale. You Are brain is not going to go out without fight. #Stiles from #TeenWolf. When Stiles went Evil. Bad Moon Arising Song Inspo. All To Well Taylor Swift The Movie Video Inspo Too. Maybe. On Human Quotient Version then. You Are going to do it anyways live in an emotional surplus. Why do not you want to eat; yet? It keeps you from emotionally swinging on the ropes. You an get up but you don' yet have safe way down. What is your baseline, grounding techniques for when you are on the ground anyways, before you go get up for The Miley Cyrus Climb?!?!?! What is your metronome, beat drop, parent functions, systems, The Power of Habit working out for you on the regularly!?!??!?!? ""If you stand for nothing then you may very well fall for everything"" -- unknown, don' know yet. And so now you know that you need life but also full life before you decide to try and aim for more. How do you count yourself in? Make room for you to be you within your life. What do you stand for? How do you create system of familiarity and regularity within your own life? Especially before stuff really starts to take off and life really starts to get going in what can sometimes feel insane especially during peak season if you do not yet have base to help prepare you with ahead of time; yet. Get ready ""Winter Is Coming"" -- GOT. But But winters peak season equivalent is of course SUMMER Peak Patio Season. What' wrong with being confident? There are many peak seasons? Are you ready for it? Demi Lovato - Cool for the Summer (Official Video) Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

this song is so iconic how people hating on this
Worst song ever It' incredible how bad this is 😂😂😂
Any haters?
"Fbxjdhfh,💋💋💋💋❤️♥️"
Back when Justin was Heart Breaker
the way in the video he tried to get gf but never did in the video. he thought
"No dislikes , This song must be good"
first video to get 1M dislikes
That hurt to watch!
2022 gang wya
Watch my new Pattaya song
am from future and commented on your video after watching this video
Now days people would say that this is cringe but back then this was good music
the best song reminds me of the first jobs in an ice cream parlor and then in an ice rink
Song so good it got zero dislikes
Udabudakuda
His parents might be really proud this little boy
Justin doing heart with his hand or these people who grabs air?
Good song!!!!!!!❤️
"Here are 100 reasons to live Family Friends Small talk with strangers The happy moments that only last few seconds The smiles from small children The memories with animals Eating you favorite food The excitement of the fairs Vacations with your family Getting your first car Graduating highschool Getting into good college Graduating college Starting your new career path Birthdays The smell of winter Hanging out with friends Job promotions Pumpkin Pie Thanksgiving Dinner Halloween Black Friday Movies Sleep overs Catching your dreams Binge watching on Netflix Homecoming Prom First Date First Kiss Christmas Morning Fireworks New Years New Discoveries Flowers Rainy Days Blankets coming out of the dryer on cold morning New relationships nice cup of tea Reading good book Drinking coffee on an early morning The joy of being sarcacstic Hidden talents Small acomplishments Adeventure The mystery of the fog The fantasy of going to never land Baby showers Weddings The big blue ocean Inside jokes with friends Family reunions walking around with colorful fuzzy socks Being able to wear whatever you want around your house The comfortable silence between two people Doughnuts snow ball fights The tooth fairy Jumping over waves The pure laughter from someone Star gazing Being weird Being diffrent Being unqiue Being Yourself Listening to you favorite song Singing in the shower Being complete goofball with your best friend Having good personality The calm before any storm The sound of thunder Looking up at full moon Imagination The feeling over proudness Baking The smell of coffee in the morning Writing Stories 2-3am talks with someone Rollercoasters Cookies Completing hard task The sound of the fire cracking on summers night Naps Walking in the words on spring afternoon Jumping in leaf piles Climbing trees The moments when you say "" Did everyone see that? Because am not doing that again"" The feeling of wrapping yourself in fuzzy and soft blanket The look of made bed Watching the leaves fall Long warm baths The smell of fresh fruit Waking up to no alarm clock Never giving up Seeing double rainbow Making one with your demons Seeing the sunrise Proving people worng Being able to take risks Being the light in every room that you walk into to, because no matter what people tell you you are amazing in every single way possible.

Justin biebier sounded like 12 yo girl-
nostalgic song that first heard when was 8 years old in 2013 and still...
Baby baby song
"“Do not embrace Ignorance” — tHB. He’ Really Big on this 7 years to 7 songs on EP Track. “And on the seventh year grow on the other side of the soil” — tHB. His ghost. Ohh this is how you can help him. could not yet get to the ghost when he felt into the real life. 2017 was going down the escalator he was going up. walk alone. But from work to the food court. People know where and how to find me. He walks with friends. He knows how and when he walks with his friends. It was his friend that said “Hey Justin” when we were just staring. They confirmed it. would not have thought too too much about it. It really was just give me 7 years and be back. Then go back seven years and you will what is up. “You Have got to go back to go forward” — tHB. So the one going down the escalator is seperate from the one coming up the escalator. But the ghost from the one going down the escalator is in the one going up the escalator. So where is his ghost. Soulfully homeless?!?!?! do Isaiah 58 fasting. In letter and in truth. Fulfilment too. My little bit of righteousness spread sporadically. The The Intro. Baby by Justin Bieber Music Video. Hard Rock, Guitar to AMC. The ones putting up movie on stage are cold on the city streets. 2017 internally freezing; for now. Because 0:04 Throw it back to the person not celebrity thing but the person walking up the stairs. Because the person going up the escalator, the ghost of the person coming down the escalator they the both of them can bring the King Kong Nicki Minaj Chun Li in the city streets?!?!! do not yet know what the King Kong sign says yet. But the ghost looking for the person can bring the King Con. But ’ not the bad guy. Looking for love. Looking for Justice. When you are loved one has been taken at the end of an injustice; what do you do then!???!? If you are fighting for your own justice and you get blank stares blinking then what do you do then?!?!?! 0:04 Baby By Justin Bieber Music Video To 2017 Escalators passing Life Experience Reference. Not everyone walks with people the same way. Make room for diversity. Equality and then Equity. Diversify, Diversify, Diversify. So then we can really unite. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

How cringe is this
"“Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB. Make Room For Snack Seizes in the fancy Restaurants. 1:06 Maejor Ali - Lolly ft. Juicy , Justin Bieber. Giving Candy Through Some Of The Music. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20. He' Giving some candy through the music! Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20. Wai8. Lolly Like lollipops. Or Lolly like the Champans popsicles. Because those are great for me!!!!!! Especially when ’ on my period. And barfing// puking my guts out. And starving because can’ hold anything down. They are the only things that can eat. And they help to cool me down because then at that time tend to also sometimes overheat. was severely anemic. Anemic not anorexic. As in low iron. Get blood test and ask to check your iron levels. Also some blood test can now check for breast cancer in both men and women. do not yet know if that tech is out their for everyone just yet, still in the trials stages. But also if you are anemic low iron eat steak and or some mixed nuts// trial mix. And or some deep ready greens like spinach and or kale. Maybe likely cooked do not know about that part though. But low and slow so that you do not burn out the nutrients. Also over the stove oats cooked in milk for fibre. Like broccoli it helps you poop. You can die from being backed up for too long. But Its also good for the heart too. Got To get some shit off your chest you know. You cannot carry that weight around forever and ever. You Have got to learn to let things go. Ventilation is not poop. do not know what the spiritual equivalent of ventilation is but its not poop. ’ still figuring that part out. But anyways …… And so low iron. Iron is good for the blood. It helps to carry the oxygen around the body throughout the bloodsteam. It helped to keep me fed and cool when was overheating and could not yet eat anything. Also great in the summer when it really really hot. To just walk with one or two on the way out. To help to regulate your body temperature. Hence they have summer time music. It just comes in doses. Not needed all the time. Every day. Everywhere. Everyone needs their summer love. Summer fun songs. And Summer time cooling down system. As long as you are having fun and not feeling shitty and nor degrading yourself in order to do it. What is summer without summer patio season!?!?!? Also sometimes you buy the desserts until you are ready more comfortable to go in and buy the meal. It can still get you through the door. I Have learned of lot of fancy places before was ready to commit towards it. “ little bit of righteousness over lot of strife” — tHB. Maybe make some fancy places with not just desserts and nor kids menus but for meals for people who are just trying to branch out. You know. Also do not always want whole ass meal. Like kids seize of salmon is really all need. snack. like leftovers. Because those are the kinds of snacks that like. do not eat full meals and finish them all the time. My snacks are not always slices of fruits. Maybe make room for snack sizes of meals in fancy restaurants. Stay safe . Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."
Sidhu is no more😓😓

It can be extra hard sometimes but stay strong and hang in there, your life matters, no one can replace you, ' thankful you are born and ' sure your struggles will pass soon! wish all of you plenty of health and strength during these tough times. remember you are strong, you got this! never forget that! sending much love over towards all of you, May god or whatever you might believe in bless you the way you need it to! ♥️🌟"

"John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Luke 13:3 [3] tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Matthew 18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Luke 6:27-38 But say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. 2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Matthew 24:4-14 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name' sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. Exodus 20 King James Version 20 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for the Lord thy God am jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour' house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour' wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour'. ..,..,..,.., ........ ........ ........ ........ .,.,,.,. .,.,.,,"

Pov: you come tiktok in 2022
Anyone in 2022?
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Biebs is aggressively pursuing this girl to include physically harassing and assaulting her? Where' cancel culture on this? Is there statute of limitations when there is video evidence such as this? We also need to figure out who wanted to further promote this behavior and digitally remaster this in 4K?!?

"※%$%&%$%##Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when print self currency and sprinkle it, such trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it. The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing scenario to most war. In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for modern nation. Electricity stops, and production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did hero side and controlled the world after the war. And got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that prevent the colonial rule. believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever. The founding of country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes Mongoloid Korean of the same kind sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. cannot perform such suicidal act. The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of nation of the United States comes from colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, believed that it was fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason. American Mason performs plot lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack ( order Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, plane shooting down case ( order Ukraine) in Malaysia. The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and phase contradicted freedom each other. If company raises profit freely, there is it, and rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if have the frames saying that do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism? The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform fixed quarrel when understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States let us you shoot missile for Japan. Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War was made to assume burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, lost on purpose. let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and share price manipulation and fraud to say and am threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold stock at profit before sudden fall obtained vast profit. pilot at .. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom Korean military unit survived to death by flame thrower. shot member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly. Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to big city of Japan and .. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to bog of the war, and they are dropped by plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God. moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming). World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war). Mount Fuji is great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in row in all parts of the world. An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. The world (Buddhists' paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024. Final note The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other kill cow pig, and to eat meat? conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because killed animal retaliates for human being, cancer occurs. The meat which ate becomes the blood, and vindictive spirit dwells in cell when blood does formation to cell. human being is cruel, and fornication, falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. thing of the world is thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It let us you compensate for human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if writhe with hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. let vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war because. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as pilot light. Are all of you ready???%&%$#%$?......................."

"This is one of the most disliked vid, but one of the best, think even haters are listening to this in 2022 |"
"Are you trying to leave? Yes. Matthew 7:5 Being in relationship can be tough. Sometimes you think ""Its love but its not love"" -- Drake. And then if you are like me you think that you got to leave and go focus on you. Go get centred with you. Or if not that you just need more love. Sometimes its not love. Sometimes its just an environmental problem. And love can make you blind and think that love is the issue and or solution. Do yourself favour and do not stop focusing on you. In and or out of relationship. Of any kind. You just might save your life. #anemia #anemicproblems. Its not broken heart syndrome. You just need more iron. ""She is not dead but sleepth. Give her meat"" -- Jesus, tHB. Eat steak. Eat some deep leafy greens. You may not even be depressed. That sadness can just be low iron. You might not even be stressed. That tiredness can and exhaustion can just be due to low iron. Especially if you have been focusing on your self care this whole time. You might not even have anxiety. Especially if you take time to get right and focus on your emotions. Those chest palpitations and randoms sporadic out of the blue rapid heart beats and stomach pains that shoot within your gut. Your not in fear. You Are not in danger. You Are in complete and calming environment. That calms you and helps you to remain calm. It might not even be fear or aniexty. It might just be low iron which is needed for food absorbstion in the gut. #braingutbiome. Maybe your spiritual walk is great. And slowly but surely you let everything go. Until it was just you. To check what is wrong with your life. All your passions, interst and hobbies because your health and good quality of life was more important. Maybe you could handle your life but still needed to make sure that you could handle you in your life as person. Sometimes its not you. Sometimes its the system. Studying to be doctor and did not learn about it (Anemia). Get blood test. It can also help detect some breast cancers too. Early research stages. Either way For anemia paid attention in health classes did not learn it. Thought was ""frequent flyer"" was in the ER' so often. Doctors did not detect it. So many different places they said was find. You ever do your HS math homework in the ER? ... fun. Went right in to my doctor first month in! He said it was fine. PLEASE STOP NORMALIZING HEAVY PERIOD PAINS AS NORMAL. THERE NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT HEAVY PAINS. And normal has range. Even for pain. There is range. When you normalize everything you negate actual non normal and you should check on this more experiences. Would could lead people to start to think that they are crazy. When really they are not crazy. The system is not lazy. Its just some people have not yet finished doing there jobs. There is still so much out there to discover, uncover. So for anyone who feels crazy, you may not be crazy. Check your environment. Your relationships, passions, interests, hobbies, etc. It was hard journey but discovered stuff about myself. It should not have had to take that long. There should be other healthier ways for catalyst for journey of self discovery. As well finding out diagnosis. Why did not they teach this? What else then have we been missing? We need to ventilate stories like this? How many other people may think that they are crazy when it could not be them. It could just be discover that has not been so widely known and or accepted yet. Anemia is not new. But why do not people make those correlation yet. When it comes to the biology of the body. You need to have seperate areas. But then you have to be able to correlate to the whole body. Inter Independence with your body also. Overall certain part and then overall and certain parts as well. Some things are connected obviously because it is the human body. And we should treat it as such as well. When you let your brain think of it like this in terms of biology. And then in other areas, like business, science, arts, etc. Then how many other discoveries solutions can also be made. #SO IS #games #connection #connectivetissue. James 2:20. Translate Your outlets. And see just what gOD can show you. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen. Are you trying to leave the relationship? To prove that it is not the relationship? Are you trying to check in with yourself to prove that the problem is not yourself? Are you trying to get centred with you, to allow yourself to get ready to level up? Are you trying to have some proper alone time to get right with gOD? Are you trying to be alone safely so that you can recharge? Are you just trying to take care of yourself? People who can take care of themselves know that something is off, when they are having some problems and or difficulties doing for themselves what they usually can do for by themselves? Sometimes its pride. Sometimes its Ego. Other times its Ego and Pride. Other times that is your internal clock sounding the alarm! That something is off. Something is really off. Know yourself. So that if the world says that you are good. You will know if their right or not. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 “To Thine Own Self Be True” — Shakespeares, Hamlet. Sometimes its not you. Sometimes, its the system. Best, . Inn Jesus Name, Amen."

"The Rapture For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger series of other subsequent events. Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And, even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life. call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live. Deuteronomy 30:19 . WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR?"

brruhhhh 2.7 billion in 2022
"was eight years old when this song came out and was singing it at the top of my lungs, growing up with you has been wonderful༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ"
"Just ask my God baby angel puppies in the back you in my haha, and love me no and you little girl and you girl? love you in my heart you break my heart so bad do have to take Facebook Facebook 😭😭😭"

He' breaking all records
"Do you consider yourself to be good person? Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of ""good."" The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God' Law . . . With tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following: 1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?) 2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made god in your mind that you are more comfortable with, god to suit yourself?) 3. You shall not take God' name in vain. (Have you ever used God' holy Name as cuss word?) 4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. 5. Honor your father and mother. 6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder). 7. You shall not commit adultery. (""Whoever looks upon woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart"" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage). 8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant). 9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions). 10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?) The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments? Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be corrupt Judge if He turned blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments? The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you are not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God' Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live. God Himself made way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn' it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves? How can we then, live ""good"" life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? ' sure you wouldn'. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, "" should enter Heaven because have done good - have earned my way in."" Imagine if you wanted to give me brand new (very expensive) car, but said, "" can' take it! feel embarrassed receiving such gift . . . here' 10 cents for it."" ' sure you would be very insulted by such pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if pay for it, it is no longer gift, it' purchase . . . it' mine by right. When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of ""self-righteousness,"" which is terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, ""For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."" You cannot earn gift. When Jesus said to ""believe"" on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust parachute to save you when you jump from plane. You don' merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don' ""jump"" without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn' want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you. Pray something like this: ""Dear God, today turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'"" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name pray. Amen."""

"Justin Bieber is such big inspiration to me and is one of the main reason why started making music in the first place. My dream is to collaborate with him one day. It would be dream come true. To anyone reading this wish you the best in chasing your dreams and perusing them. just know that anything is possible that you set your mind to. But you have to be willing to work for it. There will be tough times in your life that try to bring you down, but you need to get up and keep moving!"

2022 Still favourite ✌️🥰
"do not you think where ludacris sings as 20+ at the time , sings about hanging round the school yard is like pedo bear"
2022還在聽
Good Good
12 years ago 😣😂🤗
you are right 😢
Mine fav all time
Now if we could just go back in time when Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber were still together and there was no rare cancer or kidney transplant and no Lyme disease and no sitting in cone for mental health and they are both super healthy for the rest of their life until now and fast forward time after going back in time
Ludacris fast and the furious Drake God' plan passion fruit Tootsie and more
know the other guys from fast and the furious Paul Walker foundation donator on Microsoft Xbox times 5 with Microsoft Xbox reward points with free work done blood sweat and tears in hours and finger grinding for free in all the Forza horizon games and racing games
Now my question is. is this Selena Gomez in the video
just saw an ad on YouTube feed for the cash app take survey you may have chance to win $750 reported them for unfair business advertisement for other companies cuz know how it works you sit there for 30 minutes to an hour you fill out all their questions answer their questions with yes or no' clicking buttons then have to put in information then they bring you to other sites and ask you to fill out surveys of other companies and most of these other companies want you to pay with sub or subscription pay to complete the survey to try and possibly get $750 for the cash app to go any further or you have to buy something
#JustinBieberBaby
sang singing to katara:
changed my life

Don' like my comment 😁
"Don' really see why people hated this song...to me it shows how at that age in your life when you through break up you think you are world is over not really knowing love but you know the feeling of being very infatuated. If it was his voice think some people just over dramatic, yes it was soft but most kids at age sound like that or even softer i do not know . Not gone lie coming back to it it sounds like kids bop...but real good kids bop 👏 😆 🤣 back in the day sang this so many times lol. want to hear him sing this over now though in acoustic or remixed with now mature view on heart break story. It would still sound good can just imagine hearing him sing it slower maybe less baby baby baby but it would still sound good"

12 years have passed still love listening to this song❤
"※Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when print self currency and sprinkle it, such trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it. The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing scenario to most war. In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for modern nation. Electricity stops, and production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did hero side and controlled the world after the war. And got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that prevent the colonial rule. believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever. The founding of country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes Mongoloid Korean of the same kind sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. cannot perform such suicidal act. The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of nation of the United States comes from colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, believed that it was fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason. American Mason performs plot lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack ( order Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, plane shooting down case ( order Ukraine) in Malaysia. The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and phase contradicted freedom each other. If company raises profit freely, there is it, and rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if have the frames saying that do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism? The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform fixed quarrel when understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States let us you shoot missile for Japan. Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War was made to assume burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, lost on purpose. let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and share price manipulation and fraud to say and am threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold stock at profit before sudden fall obtained vast profit. pilot at .. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom Korean military unit survived to death by flame thrower. shot member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly. Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to big city of Japan and .. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to bog of the war, and they are dropped by plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God. moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming). World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war). Mount Fuji is great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in row in all parts of the world. An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. The world (Buddhists' paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024. Final note The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other kill cow pig, and to eat meat? conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because killed animal retaliates for human being, cancer occurs. The meat which ate becomes the blood, and vindictive spirit dwells in cell when blood does formation to cell. human being is cruel, and fornication, falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. thing of the world is thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It let us you compensate for human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if writhe with hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. let vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war because. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as pilot light. Are all of you ready?"

hated this dude just cuz he was little older than me and lot of the girls around me were obsessed with him. was jealous. But damn now looking back just laugh.

Let' see how many people are there in 2022!
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD after 12 year
"Can Christian Fall Away & Return to God? Question from Site Viewer Initially, joined Baptist church, and believed to accept Jesus in seventh grade and was baptized. For couple years was really involved. But then fell away. prayed at times and felt could live in worldly fashion–greedy for money, hungry for lust, etc.–then just ask for forgiveness and be safe. grew in anger and hostility to religion. really fell away and turned and said things now regret. am now 29. Recently, all of sudden have had this burning and overwhelming desire to read the Bible and search for meaning. have become hardened over time, and do struggle with temptations and wrongful thoughts. But now the Gospel is hitting me and know have erred. am deeply troubled however by Hebrews 6:4-6 and 2 Peter 2:20-22 and Hebrews 10:26. Is it not possible for someone to return to repentance after having denied God earlier? Can person who goes through the motions, then goes his own way, come to repentance? Or have crossed point of no return? Is it impossible to truly follow Jesus Christ again and be saved as these verses seem to indicate? Or is falling away consistent state that can be broken? 1 Timothy 1:13 is troubling as well. What if one willfully sins after having knowledge? Can Christian fall away and ever receive God’ mercy again? am really struggling with these sorts of chapters dealing with apostasy. just feel like am lost. Please help! Tim’ Answer First, would commend to you the article Does God Want Me Back, where we address your question as it relates to Hebrews 6:4-6 and Hebrews 10:26. God is the God Jesus told us about in Luke 15. He always welcomes the sinner back. No matter how badly His people have sinned, His desire is their return. If you fall away and return, the Father will welcome you with open arms. If you have trouble believing this, challenge you sometime to begin with Isaiah and read through all of the prophets and mark how badly they had sinned and how many times God continued to call them to repent. And even when they ultimately did not repent, and God brought judgment, God promised to go with them into captivity and to bring them back. As He says in Ezekiel 18, He has no pleasure in the death of those who fall away, but rather wants them to repent. He is the Father who has more joy over one sinner who repents than over 99 sheep who need no repentance. From Abraham to Peter, we have long history of God’ people falling away and the Father welcoming them back when they turn to Him. So, can say with confidence that even if you fall away, if you seek God, you will find Him and in your finding your heart will be delighted. You ask about 2 Peter 2:20-22. The character of false teachers is that they have no desire to repent. They desire the pigpen, the vomit. The point is that they never knew Christ, but were always pigs and dogs. They were never sheep. They did not fall away. The 2 Peter passage does not speak to the issue of those who desire to repent. For such people, God’ arms are always open. He delights in our return. Is this not the entire point of the parable of the prodigal son? And if he did not delight in our return, there would not be person on earth that would have any hope. While you may have fallen away like the prodigal son and others may be like the elder son, both needed to have father who was willing to forgive them. Each of us have sinned. We may think some sins are big and some are small, but the point is that we all have sinned and fallen short of God’ glory. And, we all have sinned willfully. Those who think otherwise are deceiving themselves. If the Father did not forgive our sins, none of us would have any hope. But His great desire is to have His creation be in fellowship with Him. You ask about 1 Timothy 1:13, where Paul found mercy because he sinned ignorantly in unbelief. That passage is an interesting passage. Translated woodenly, the passage reads “because being ignorant did [it] in unbelief.” The focus is that the mercy was extended, not because of ignorance, but because of unbelief. Mercy is always needed for unbelief. It is not needed for belief. Mercy did not come because of ignorance, but because of unbelief. As .. Robertson points out in his tome Grammar of the New Testament, the participle “being ignorant” carries “manner” meaning rather than “causal” meaning. Stated in another way, Paul lived and did all of these things in the state of unbelief, while he was ignorant. God’ mercy was extended because of Paul’ unbelief, not because of Paul’ ignorance. Paul’ ignorance was an accompanying manner or characteristic of his unbelief, but it was not the reason for the mercy. The mercy came because of the unbelief, which is why we all need mercy. The context also draws us to this reading. In 1 Timothy 1:15, Paul states that he was the chief of sinners. There are no sinners greater than Paul was. God is not saying, and Paul is not saying, that there are certain sinners who act ignorantly and on these God will have mercy but for the greater sinners who act deliberately God will not have mercy. Such reading would do violence to the text. How can Paul be the worst of sinners if he only sinned ignorantly while others sin intentionally? This makes no sense. And if Paul is making distinction between willful and ignorant sins, then how could God ever show all longsuffering to Paul as pattern for the rest of us? None of the rest of us can claim that we have never sinned willfully. The passage should not be read to state that God used Paul as this great example to us but actually there is no hope for the rest of us because Paul’ example does not fit us. Such would turn the passage on its head. Moreover, all of Scripture is filled with examples of intentional sins. Abraham asked Sarah to lie for him; David murdered Uriah; Manasseh did more evil than all the kings before him; Peter denied Christ, the prodigal son left his family for an intentional life of sin . . . If we take the position that intentional sins are not forgiven, then are we consigning Abraham, David, Manasseh, and Peter to hell? Did not all these believers fall away? Did Jesus misspeak when He told about the reception of the prodigal son? read 1 Timothy 1:13 as saying that God extended mercy precisely because of the need for mercy in Paul. Paul was acting in unbelief and was ignorant, and needed mercy. That is the condition of us all before we come to Christ (see Ephesians 4:18). We are ignorant and are in unbelief. In any event, Paul in 1 Timothy 1:13 is talking about his conversion to Christ. He is not talking about the forgiveness of sins and restoration of fellowship for believers. To those who are believers and err, Paul admonishes the church to restore such one in the spirit of gentleness (Galatians 6:1). There is forgiveness with God. It is His nature and delight to forgive, restore, and renew hearts. My encouragement to you is to seek God. have long thought that even if Scripture said there was no hope, the proper response of us all would be to petition heaven and seek to serve God, understanding like the Ninevites of old that perhaps God will change His mind (Jonah 3:7-9; see also David in 2 Samuel 12:22). God may be gracious even as He was to Israel after He told them they had gone too far and He was through with them (Judges 10:13, 16; 11:32). But we do not face such situation. Rather, we have God who pleads with us to return to Him. As Isaiah 55:6-7 so eloquently states: Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord and He will have mercy on him and to our God for He will abundantly pardon. If you will spend your lifetime seeking and serving God in mercy, truth, and love, you will come to the end of life happy man. You will be surprised how through the years your life is transformed into the image of His Son, Jesus. Instead of hatred, there will be love; instead of irritation, there will be longsuffering. Instead of sadness, there will be joy. Instead of anxiety, there will be peace. Instead of being controlled by one’ emotions, there will be self-control so that the emotions serve you and do not imprison you. You will experience some of heaven on this earth, as you experience the Holy Spirit in the life of following Christ. And though it may take some time to reform your mind to get rid of the things you have placed in there, through memorization of the Word, prayer, and focus, you can win that battle and look back with thanksgiving and gratitude to God for mind, heart, and life that feels clean and pure. May the Lord Jesus be the brother besides you, the companion within you, and the joy before you."

who still lessening to this song 2022 ?
Who see this song in 2022 . This song never old. 😍😍😄😄🤣
2022😊😊😊
2009 back 2022😆
❤️🖤one of favourites...
"Being rich and famous is not sinful. However, making that primary pursuit in life is sinful. “People who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction” (1 Timothy 6:9, NLT). “Do not toil to acquire wealth” (Proverbs 23:4, ESV). The world would have us believe that the only way to become rich and famous is to set goals and pursue them doggedly. The Bible paints different picture. Consider three biblical figures whose examples speak to this issue: 1. First and foremost is Jesus. When tempted by Satan, He intentionally rejected the opportunities to become rich and famous (Matthew 4:1–11). Jesus devoted Himself to the tasks God gave Him (John 5:19). We are compelled to take the attitude of Jesus, “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing. . . . He humbled himself” (Philippians 2:5–8).What was the result of Jesus’ humbling Himself? “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name” (verse 9). 2. Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. As slave, he had no ambitions to be rich and famous. He only did the work that was put before him. In Potiphar’ house, Joseph’ faithfulness resulted in his being put in charge of everything. Later, in jail, he helped his fellow prisoners, earning trust that ultimately led to his being put in charge of all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. In short, Joseph focused on what God wanted him doing, and as result he became one of the most powerful and famous men in the world (see Genesis 37—41). 3. He was not wealthy, but the apostle Paul was perhaps the most famous Christian ever to live. How did his fame become worldwide and timeless? He simply did what God put him on earth to do: make disciples. He certainly had claim to worldly fame, describing some of his accomplishments in Philippians 3:4–6. Yet what did he think about these pursuits that would have warranted fame? “Whatever were gains to me now consider loss for the sake of Christ” (verse 7). Paul’ ambition was never to become famous or gather the accolades of men. His burning ambition was to do God’ work and glorify Christ. That was his higher calling. In Matthew 6:10–20, Jesus teaches us not store up treasures on earth, but in heaven. Then He says, “You cannot serve both God and money” (verse 24). And “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things [the basic necessities of life] will be given to you as well” (verse 33). That is, stop trying to be rich and famous, and instead simply seek after God, living out His purposes for your life. If God wants earthly riches to come your way, they will. For those whose ambition is to be rich, the Bible has many cautions. Jesus said that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:24). Material wealth has way of taking our eyes off of what’ important and eternal. Jesus’ parable of the rich fool in Luke 12:16–21 teaches that it is foolish to store up earthly things and take no thought of heavenly things. As for pursuing fame, the Bible is equally cautioning: “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled” (Matthew 23:12). Paul says that “ person with changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people” (Romans 2:29, NLT). James asks, “Don’ you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (James 4:4). Those who are rich and famous often struggle to obey basic biblical commands such as “Be content with what you have” (Hebrews 13:5) and “Do not be proud, but enjoy the company of the lowly. Do not be conceited” (Romans 12:16, BSB) and “Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you” (James 5:1). To be clear, it’ not wrong to have wealth. It’ the love of money that is root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). But those with wealth should understand where the wealth comes from (God), the purpose for having it (to further God’ work), and it’ transitory nature (see Proverbs 23:5). Ecclesiastes 2:24 notes, “ person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil.” But the same passage clarifies the Source of our blessings: “This too, see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?” (verses 24–25). We should not make fame and fortune primary pursuit in life. Rather, we should make glorifying God our primary goal. We love Jesus and obey Him (John 14:15). We follow Jesus, which means we deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow wherever He leads (Mark 8:34). Jesus blesses the meek (Matthew 5:5); being rich and famous is not usually His plan for His children in this world."

"Fucking YouTube algorithm. How this shit sandwich showed up in my recommendations is beyond me. ' so surprised, had to comment. mean, wouldn' listen to this crap even at gunpoint. The fact that it has 2billion + views just reinforces my opinion on most young people out there. If there' any adults listening to this crap, they should be embarrassed. There is real music out there, you should do yourselves favor and expand your tastes, because this shit, is fuckin preteen clown shoes."

Remember!??? when Mina,Sana, Nayeon and Chaeyoung and (may be all the TWICE members) said that they often sings and dances to this BABY song by JB at their young ages of (12 yrs /13 years)!????? And they all are fan of Justin Bieber!!!! So amazing!!!! Love the time!!! 💖⏳😇 JB love you!!! 😘😘😘😘😘"

"happy birthday🎂to the king, to the savior of billion lives, to the most beautiful, kind, and talented man on earth.💜 #JustinBieber wish you the best on your birthday my king. if we tryna go back to the timestamp when an angel was sent from heaven, it was in 1st march, 1994, London Ontario Canada' Jude' Hospital' second floor' 126 number room, in 12:56 minutes 58 seconds:)♡ first time got to know Justin was in 2018 with his Boyfriend song we all know how handsome he looked on the mv how easy it was for every girls to crush on him😌 i am so proud of you Justin, you deserve all the achievements that you have today. ♡Justin Bieber is the most subscribed solo artist on YouTube. ♡Justin Bieber is the only singer whose YouTube videos' views are more than 20billion. ♡Justin Bieber is the first and only artist who has 5 songs with 1billion+2billion+3billion views in his channel. ♡Justin Bieber is the artist who got world famous in only 14 years old. ♡Justin Bieber is the most followed singer on whole social media platforms. ♡Justin Bieber is the prince of pop, new king of pop, current king of pop. Last but not the least, Justin Bieber is the 2nd most awarded male artist with 617+ awards meanwhile Michael Jackson is the first one with 1k awards. Crazy to think how 28 years old guy has become next MJ with talent.❣😚 Justin Bieber' mom Pattie Mallette was aborted to kill her son by her husband (Justin' dad) Jeremy Bieber. fortunately she never did it. After all the dangerous situations she went through, finally gave birth to her adorable son 28 years ago today. today, that baby is none other than 4.7billion Beliebers' diamond Justin Bieber.<33 after Justin got much fame, his cruel dad really came back to them. Crazy to think Justin made sure to forgive that cruel dad who tried to kill him! and still he makes sure to say that he has beautiful mother and beautiful father. let' fall in love with the mercifulness of Justin Bieber. always💜 one of my favourite inspirations Gautam Buddha one day saw in the streets that person was hurting duck physically. the duck was so hurt and was bleeding. soft hearted Gautam Buddha then also hurt himself by piercing the arrows on his hands to feel the duck' pain. just like that, after so many years in 2018, kind of same thing was done by Justin Bieber. while doing morning walk, Justin saw some homeless people were lying down in the streets. they had no place to live. they had stone instead of pillows to sleep on. kind hearted Justin Bieber felt nothing to go to them and lied down beside them with stone. just to feel them. yeah he did, he literally knows the pain for not having anything because he also went through that moment in his childhood. crazy to think the boy who incomes 285 million dollars in year is lying down in streets with stone beside homeless people. yes! because he knows, an artist' job isn' only singing and dancing and entertaining audience but also many other unique duties. how not to love such angel?♡ not perfect Justin Bieber is. he had mistakes. you won' see any other celebrity to apologise this much for making some little mistakes. he' so sincere. can literally make thousands of paragraphs by writing all the beautiful sides of Justin Bieber but restricting my love for him in facebook status is so impossible. Justin was silent for 4 straight years. his mistakes, weakness, imperfections everything he had put behind the back of him. after making ownself great again and being confident, he came back with masterpiece album ""Changes"" where he has shown off his changes throughout the years. that album placed in 200 hot billboard. it was his being no1 for the 7th time. many people sing songs. but how many people sing those songs which even change people' lives? Justin' lyrics, words, speeches, are the best thing that can light up your mood when you are down. he has unlimited awards. his voice is heart warming. his eyes are full of dreams. his heart is full of love. his records are uncountable. can' even remember all right now. Happiest 28th birthday, Justin Bieber. you inspire us like nobody else. you have created irreplaceable level blast since you have entered the industry. legend. real king. thankyou for saving my life,thankyou for existing. your existence= full of talent, full of kindness, full of cuteness♡ the ending will be with an iconic speech of Justin Bieber~ ""Everytime we wake up is another blessing. Follow your dreams, never let anything, anyone chase you. Never say Never"" ❤"
Happy birthday Justin bieber ❤💝🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊 my favorite singer in the world 🌎 ❤ jb

"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:7) When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Mark 2:17)"
Anyone listening to 2022?
"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:15) The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. (Psalms 14:1-4)"

Listen the year 2022
"remember great moments now, love this song"
Where is 2022???
We have saw the evolution of Justin from kid to Men in his channel 👍
"remember wonderful moment: You appeared before me, Like fleeting vision, Like genius of pure beauty. In the languor of hopeless sadness, In the anxieties of noisy bustle, gentle voice sounded to me for long time And dreamed of cute features. Years passed. Storms are rebellious gust Dispelled the old dreams, And forgot your gentle voice, Your heavenly features. In the wilderness, in the darkness of imprisonment My days dragged on quietly Without divinity, without inspiration, Without tears, without life, without love. The soul has awakened: And here you are again, Like fleeting vision, Like genius of pure beauty. And the heart beats in ecstasy, And for him they were resurrected again Both divinity and inspiration, And life, and tears, and love."

"FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️ SAW NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then , John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as bride adorned for her husband. 3 And heard loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥"

"Its 2022 february 21,let' see how many legends are here after 12 year' and Still favourite song,Its not song its an Memory of Many thing'..."
"remember seeing this on tv as kid. Initial thoughts, cute. The bullying of JB at the time, for fricking while, was disgraceful. Those people hope were ashamed of themselves & improved upon their attitudes. Doesn’ even matter if his image or music had gotten better or if he had not had more music made after. Bullying like that isn’ good especially to kid/teen/young adult. was not one of those people, to say anything mean/unfair about him, thank goodness, and full honesty didn’ see reasons for it. Biever - didn’ make sense. Where’ the bieverness that was just dumb spin on his name. His hair was cool, that was the skater boy anime fashion look. And the song was catchy and sweet. Many kids were like that in those days in their early teens. Bullying like that on such huge scale wasn’ funny. He’ strong for sticking with his passions & getting past that and continuing to make music and be in his videos even. Bcoz lot of people & media weren’ even deserving of them you know. 👏 💖"

"This song reminds me of my childhood and my first love fr 😂 On our break into my school had tv and used to play this videoclip and everyone talking about Justin. was like 9 or 10 at the time this song was released and there was this boy that was my classmate, he had his hair just like Justin into this vid, everyone used to call him younger Justin. He had his hair all straight into this same shape. used to like him and he was my friend, we used to sit together and everything. Then at the end of the year he came like ""want to be my girlfriend"", he asked multiple times and never answered 😂 Good times"
this is lenged song most listened song and fav to.
"don' care what people think of him, this song always connects me back to my childhood nostalgia when listened Justin first time in my life and felt so stunning."

"It is destined for people to die once, and after this comes judgment Hebrews 9:27 NASB But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 NASB For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:16 NASB Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38 NASB Jesus answered, Truly, truly, say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 3:5 NASB For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons and daughters of God. Romans 8:14 NASB The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 NASB Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever person sows, this he will also reap. Galatians 6:7 NASB For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins, Hebrews 10:26 NASB Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it. Matthew 7:13-14 NASB THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND WHICH HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HUMAN HEART, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM. 1 Corinthians 2:9 NASB This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:14 NASB"

Boy sounds like girl
"This is not just song but time machine for me to look back at my childhood. This shall always have special in my heart. : How were the 2010s like? : The era when very young Justin Bieber had just started. 💗 The 90s kids were living the time of their life. They were the new adults who were seeing the best of both worlds. They were the ones who were making memories and inspiring our generation. 😌 The world was better place... And somewhere silently we 2000s kids were enjoying our childhood too; growing up in that era listening to these wholesome songs and discussing about them in our schools. Today 11 years later, am not that 8 year old kid anymore... 🤧 Never ever in my worst of dreams did ever think, the world would be suffering like this. My heart aches on seeing how our generation is growing up in these difficult pandemic times, unable to even go outside and see the world. 🥺 was born in November 2002 and honestly wish was born 10 years back... just to have witnessed the best of times with my whole consciousness as teen/adult and not as kid. Hoping for the best for everybody! 🧡"

Feel free to use this comment as the Dislike Button
"This lyrical genius would put William Shakespeare to shame, he is genius, Eminem who? only know JB, who revolutionized the world, when aliens visit us, NASA' first action would be to make them listen to this masterpiece, and they' vibe to it harder than Russian man who drank 5 bottles of vodka, ' sure of it, and in fact, when historians hundreds of years in the future would think of the 21st century, the first thing they would think of is Baby by JB, this song was the song that successfully achieved world piece during 2010, and in conclusion, this truly is certified hood classic"

was 0 years old when this song came out!!!
thougt this song was sing by girl until saw the video song
"2:14 when was 13, had my first love derwasnobadiganawinidumabinibinawowsws"
"The Christian God is the True God and am going to prove it right now: God has Law called the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). These Laws include do not lie, do not steal, don’ put others gods before Him (Exodus 20) Have you ever broken any of these Laws? Have you ever told lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever lusted after someone? If we really went over God’ Laws in the Bible, every single one of them, it can really expose how much of sinner we truly are and because we have all committed these acts our punishment is Hell because God’ standard is perfection. Our good works cannot get us into Heaven. That’ like you steal soda from the store but you tell the judge, “hey judge give to the orphanage, do community service.” The judge will not care about what you did. You stole something that was not yours so therefore the Judge is going to find you guilty. God is the same way. But, this Judge is loving Judge who does not want to sentence you for your crimes. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to come and take the punishment for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and accept jesus Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved from the sentence. Jesus loves you and is not willing that any should perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16) God bless"

"One should try to be little more beautiful. He should learn to be little kinder, not offended, but not offended. More than being loved, she should know how to love beautifully. He should do finesse, try to tolerate it. When you believe that you are beautiful, then beauty will come. Patience is also prayer."

"'know, like, love or hate this song? It came out almost twelve years ago. really need to stop scouring the Internet for excuses to feel old, but damn if this isn' reason to feel so. wasn' even ten when this song came out. Now ' pushing twenty. All had to worry about when this song was new was if the school cafeteria happened to be serving stuffed crust pizza that day. We have gone from counting its dislikes to not being able to tell at all. But, well... used to hate this song as kid on account of it being too childish and girly to my young ears (despite being too childish to understand what the words even meant). Now have passing appreciation for it and the time period it represented, and ' currently up to my ears in MLP merch (because mentioned offhandedly that ' never watched the show but thought it was animated well and had good morals, and my youngest female cousin must be psychic, and forced enough merch on me to finally cave in and watch it. don' necessarily consider the show girly, more girl-oriented, but, well, it was made with girls in mind). Crazy what dozen years'll do, huh?"
what was DRAKE doing there ..
Filmes. Velozes. Tpp. 10. No. Brasil
POV: you came here to see dislikes but you can'.
"shouldn' have listened to this on Jan 2(2022) . Wtf... feel void suddenly. Love this song and of course JB, it' just that nostalgia hit me hard."

Girl, quit playing We are just friends, what are you saying? Said, ""There' another"" and look right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time and was like Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine Oh, for you would have done whatever And just can' believe we ain' together And want to play it cool, but ' losin' you will buy you anything, will buy you any ring And ' in pieces, baby, fix me And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream ' going down, down, down, down And just can' believe my first love won' be around and ' like Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine Luda! When was 13, had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy Oh, was star-struck She woke me up daily, don' need no Starbucks She made my heart pound It skip beat when see her in the street and At school on the playground but really want to see her on the weekend She knows she got me dazing Because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking but just keep on saying Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh Thought you' always be mine, mine ' gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Now ' all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Now ' all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Now ' all gone (gone, gone, gone) ' gone"

Legends listening 31st dec 2021
"3:06 Ohh so maybe he sold his soul. To get the soul stone. 3:22 In order to better get to his love. When she needed help the most. 2:18 Tamar was drowning. 2:33 He needed to get through the fog!!! Pass the fog sometimes is the cliff dive. 2:54 Tamar was drowning. Chained to the problems that she may have felt chained to the bottom under the water. The resistance your triggers, your warning signals, your gut instinct to try and keep you safe. But when love is drowning and potentially dying. Well... You will do almost anything for the ones that you love. gOD will find way for his anointed. aLWAYS. believe that. You may have met the good Samaritan of the flesh. But what about the good Samaritan of the spirit?? How you survive the pandemic is between you and gOD. Same with how you may have tried to held from your problems that may have happened in gOD' time. Address the problem not just how people solved the problem. Things spread good and bad, choose wisely. What about Tamar and how she was choosing to solve her problem. John 8! You cannot tell me that Tamar was not the adulteress. The lady with man men but no husbands. The lady at the well. Did jESUS not give her pure water. It was not to address then yet the Men adn why they cheated. But to address the problem. On why she only went after marriage men. You had to be unpacked to married back then. What then did she at least ask before she was fully violated. Violated in more ways then one. ""Let he without sin cast the first stone"" -- Jesus. The debater. Fighting on the lowly' defence. Song Inspo Music Video Chained by Nick Jonas. Best, . In Jesus Name, Amen."
Drakes on set and they bring in Ludacris? Bad call
"Invading People Privacy to see if they are trust worthy. Vetting: There' Got To be better way! Maybe kING dAVID was applying his critical and strategic thinking from life of war on the war zone with gOD while still in gOD anointed; to his family. But that being said when it comes to family you John 8 ""Let every man go unto his own home"" __ THB. But also ""grow on your own soil"" -- THB yes. But blood is thicker then water. And so water will help you to see better. Talking about what is happening with other peoples families. Is how you can not hide the saying of the dark from the youth. Health and safety, the power of habit book inspo. How you can come up with you rules for you and yours when it comes to family due to because fo other peoples family. But also to protect your own. And help guide other should they be ready to branch out to other peoples families and start there own families. But before that for when they are to hang out with friends and friends of the family. Not just them but also there family' family. The art of war. Translated to the Art of War: Family Addition. But that requires patience. And patience requires communication, other wise your more at risk to potentially man down, the wrong person. Especially if you are trying to learn where you are assailants assailant had learnt it from. Maybe your assailant was child. And so any and all areas that you are assailant learnt it from was wrong. Maybe that is how you uncover bigger problem. And trying to find truth after could be how you uncover massive cover up! ""Get to the root of what you don' yet fully understand"" -- THB. But what happens what that root is very deep and just keeps going and going. See from Reading The Holy Bible we know that there was Jonadab but the other people in The Holy Bible did not know. But maybe from King Davids training and experience in the war he could have figure as much. Maybe King David was just trying to smoke him out. Breath of Life Florence and the machine. That requires patience as well which requires open communication. But when you are not sure who to trust especially in your family. ""You run the risk of blessing curse and //or cursing blessing"" -- THB. Yes faith but at the same time don' be dumb. ""Do not embrace ignorance"" -- THB. Working and dealing with another family is how you can work while you wait. Have open communication. But how do you start to build trust when there might just be snake all up in that grass. You could be telling them your warnings. You educating. 8 ball. Protect the children. In this family we do not take kill shots. Jonadab' law. Because dead man can' pay and also dead man can' day who set them up. Ever wonder why scar had such big scar on his face. That was Jonadab and//or that was maybe even the snake. Or the frog or pinnochino or the liar. How do you uncover fake rose in the garden, that there is soil underneath the sidewalks, let it all grow out! That someone is lying! Honest and direct communication! You ever play broken telephone how does the game end! Let some lies pile up and then address it at dinner time. That Is when Tamar' brother killed her brother -- Caine and Abel -- but with good fulfilment trying to protect loved one. Hence why Jesus said ""For it is not the letter of the law, but the fulfilment"" -- THB when debating with the Pharises. Why he was outside of the church with the lowly. Where was Tamar when it was all said and done. Covered in Ashes, in grief with little to no color clothing. Where was Tamar' brother after he killed to protect his sister? Outside of the house of King David sin exile. Not everyone runaway some are kicked out. Jesus the ""lowly there is wisdom"" -- THB. aNd so also the doctor for the lowly, ""The whole need not doctor"" -- THB. For which there was originally shepherd who went back for his lost sheep. That being said how did Jesus handle the dinner after relaunched and recreate to smoke out Jonadab. To smoke out Judas. Dinner with direct and honest communication! In other words and intervention. Now tAMAR was not on the outskirts with the brother who killed her brother. And she knew that she had brother of the clothes friend within the church; sent to her by gOD. Who she could have also known outside of the church. But she also had lover outside of the church. Sent to her by gOD. who she maybe did not know was of the cloth. Tamar lover sent by gOD could have very well fxxked up some shit with gOD in hurry to make things right and or help tAMAR walking around in ashes outside of the church. Do you ever why lUCIFER crossed the line? The Police line? Why does anyone do anything?? LOVE !!!!!! ""If its always open then its no longer clean"" -- THB. One opened box stacked on bunch of other sealed ones. He could not do it on his own and so hE got tAMARs brother of the cloth from inside the church; to help out with// when it comes to help. tAMAR stood on her truth and her righteousness. And maybe that is why gOD sent jESUS to create the church outside of the church. To help heal the problems of what is going on inside the church. Someoen needs to do undercover boss. But someone needs to still work deep within the shop. Someone else needs to still run lead the shop. The art of war and th art of war family addition. Both run on your own soil. But there just run little different. Family edition is at times of peace. 1984. What kind of peace are you thinking. Are you fighting for peace? And or are you fighting for pieces. Peace with need then some healthy and safe ventilation if they are to lay down in green pastures. ADN not burn the soil to fight and address the truth. Frozen 2. Kept truth and righteousness seperate. You have have peace on the axis. Righteousness little bit and lot of it can have peace. Truth, truth for truth and truth for solution can have peace. First. Until then let it be like the Bahamian sea touches the ocean. Where Truth and righteousness may dance, meet, but they do not merge. If you want to go to the ocean you plan for it. Same with times of peace. Hence why Jesus has both keys. ""Count the cost less you be laughed to scorn"" -- Judas with his ""False balance is an abomination unto the lORD thy gOD"" -- THB. Math Algebra. What happens when gOD has an abomination but your not trying to be failed jOB? Fail in the valley! cHRIST street living!!!! That Is on the truth side of shit!! Chirstian Philosophy? ""Rejoice in the truth and not the choas"" -- THB at 3. Ventilation at 7. And truth for solution at the river with the net at 11. But you have got to go the distance. DOn' skip steps. 1st string. Completiong brings you to 2nd string. Completion brings you to 3rd string. Sometimes its all of them. But really Tides and harvest. ""Leave the first to gOD"" -- THB and ""Save half for harvest"" -- THB. And so as such deal with the truth, the fruits of your labour, the grim reaper, at harvest. After you have completed the full circle of one. You grow and move forward to two. If there are whole and or false balance. Well that is what said. And also seventh day of rest. Let gOD and aBEL do its thing. You know aBEL works different. But still anointed. Probably making the letter for all that is fulfilment to visually see in the flesh how Christianity is really doing. Look at America and tell me ' wrong. Christianity needs some ventilation. How you handle aMERICA is how you handle gODs kingdom. Its not just the land of the soulless from carbon monoxide poisoning due to lack of healthy adn safe space for ventilation. Its also Judas balancing out ""Knowledge for unerstanding"" -- THB. Left side for right side. Letter for fulfilment. You need the vision to see. And to think for solution to move forward. That why my Dad brought me into society. Which community is best for you. And what you can see? And what you can do? Hence why the gOOD sAMARITHAN lives within the village. Will ride or die and ressurect best from inside the village. And then Caine can see and speak on this. But needs great place to catch it. See how its made. ""Be Bold Like Lion"" -- THB. Cool running. Book end what has been learnt. Righteousness making better system. And then sowing new seeds. Uprooting the corrupt ones. have not gotten to the other side of the soil; fully though yet. gOD did not explain fulfilment before exiling kING dAVID. And kING dAVID did not explain his vetting art of war family edition. And so his son killed his other son who assaulted their sister. Either way lack of communication. High Risk that the war was rushed. The battles were won. The wars potentially lost. Communication is key. Good Communication is key!!! You just need to know who and how to trust. You do not want to love with bruised and or broken heart. Especially if you can help it. ANd nobody wants to feel dismissed, mistrusted and //nor disrespected. Everyone wants to feel honored, validated, respected, with something, trusted. Work while you wait. Work where you can. Pockets full of sunshine. BBTM they still help. My head. That Is all I Have got for now. Best, . In Jesus Name, Amen."
"0:45 Justin Bieber has been Drew from Feburary 2010! -- Just in Time. 2:03 Ohhhh do you ever stop to think that maybe the Ash falling down on lUCIFER in heLL is maybe that from tAMAR' heart. Why did the aNGEL really truly fall and//or get casted out??? Lil Nas ' Montero? Fallen to stripper pole? kING dAVID' daughter why did she use the ashes?? 2:19???Chains Music Video by Nick Jonas??Follow me into Christian Philosophy would you. For the church outside of the church? Tamar Maybe???? Maybe he is just trying to help his love? Maybe it was just her brother that was shooter for her in the house. The one who murder her brother the one who assaulted. Maybe Tamar also really but truly had lover in the church. One who courted her. Who she was saving herself for marriage for. Who she really truly loved. Who like her was also gOD fearing. Maybe aDAM ate the aPPLE to try and understand his lover. To try adn see if hE too could also help her. When your rib hurts you hurt too!! To be clear am not saying that Tamar was in love with her brother. Either of them. She had gOD first. She then had herself, her family and then the church and lover that she had in the church. Maybe that is where she met and//or also knew lUCIFER. Remember hE was cast out, but then why was he cast out. Maybe that was her brother covered up under the cloth. Sometime you have your family that you are born into (Blood of the flesh) . Other times you have the family that gOD choses for you (Blood of Jesus -- Blood of the Spirit: Follow Sheep in Christianity ). And then you have the family that gOD also chose for you. Same thing. (Blood of Jesus -- Blood of the Spirit: Follow Sheep in Christianity ).But romantic relationship sent to you and//or sent for you by gOD. You know. Serendipity for some. Others only met by the grace of gOD. So maybe tAMAR had friend in the church. brother of gOD' hOLY sPIRIT that she was friends with inside the world but also knew inside the church. Adn then she had her own lover covered under the sent to her by gOD. Like Bathesha -- maybe that is who is her mOTHER. aLL of kING dAVID' children, wives, concubines, we don' truly know what happened to bATHSHEBA. Hence why kING dAVID could have been so eager to find out what truly happened to tAMAR. Because you will be loved where you have not yet healed. Second chance at fate. Redemption. second chance into gOD' good graces. Jesus' Bridesgroom: Don' sleep on your abilities. Maybe that why kING dAVID was so destraught when tAMAR' brother killed their other brother/the assaulter. Maybe kING dAVID was just trying to smoke out jONADAB. Find out who he truly was. Maybe that is why jUDAS has not yet come back in; to any gets. ""Knowledge for understanding"" -- THB. ""Due Diligence"" -- THB. ""Grow on your own soil""-- THB. Is just trying to understand what he did not fully get. When he was in the fields of blood and then understood the weight of what it meant for him when he betrayed jESUS. Peter may be in charge, but Judas may be working like aBEL of the second testament. Sometimes maybe offering Olive Branches. Sometimes maybe balancing out the Letter for the fulfilment. That may also be why Libra is off balanced. Fruits of the flesh to fruits of the spirit is not yet balanced within the society. Like of the flesh fruits of the spirit needs ventilation. Healthy and safe space to vent. Carbon Monoxide is silent killer. There should be place for that throughout the week and//or on sUNDAYS????Christain Philosophy for the Church outside of the Church!! For the house of the mourning and//or when you get to the rIVER???? Maybe??? 8 Ball. Best, . In Jesus Name, Amen."

"' Gen and used to hate this song...... now really love it, hehe! Great song! Goes to show how sometimes you must appreciates yours generations music plus the nostalgia! listen to oldies, but they don' hit me like 2000s and early 2010s. ' just barely getting into current music and well once it' embraced enough one can like it! From now on ' going give more love to our generations music. So far 2020s are starting off pretty great! Loads of great songs that are under appreciated these past years especially from old music listeners like me. Time to move on from the past! Ooorah!"

Imagine this song still exist on 2050
"Jesus is Lord. God bless. He loves and Forgives. God isn' someone who waits for your downfall, but your redemption through His Son Jesus. Repent. This may seem uncalled for but just trust the Lord. Give God chance, not being religious but have relationship with God. Call out to Him and try and hear His voice in your heart, He doesn’ go against His Word, the Bible. If you reject it, ay your choice, God gives free will. Just got to say, He has plans to prosper you not to harm you. Again ain' saying be religious, but give God chance. God bless you."

When was thirteen, had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came to between us or could ever come above She had me going crazy, oh, was starstruck She woke me up daily, don' need no Starbucks She make my heart pound skip beat when see her in the street and At school, on the playground But really want to see her on the weekend She knows she got me dazing Because she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking But just keep on saying Baby, baby, baby, ooh,like Baby, baby, baby, no, like Baby, baby, baby, ooh Thought you' always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, ooh,like Baby, baby, baby, no, like Baby, baby, baby, ooh Thought you' always be mine, mine ' gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah) (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Now ' all gone"

Justin Bieber is so racist.

YouTube removed DISLIKES.... wow.... we know this video has more dislike in the world.
They removed the fricking dislikes :(
"POV: you were going to make comment about how this song must be great because it has 0 dislikes, but then you couldn’ because there were already lot of comments about that"
he has not hit puberty yet
The dislikes aren' shown. But we know they are there.
Did saw drake in this video
Emo 😈👍🏻
Justin Bieber likes Brunettes know because one time he put picture of girl bit before he got married and he was who is this girl? want to meet her and she was brunette and Selena and Miranda from VS who he fell for were brunettes so think he more attracted to brunettes especially because he kind of has blonde hair and usually you are attracted to what you don' have
Kids need to know this song had 13M dislike before YT remove Dislike 🤣

No more feedback and opinions can be viewed from this world. Its over. People who deserve pain and misery on their vids can no longer be hated. Justin Bieber lives another day without the hate. You are welcome!

Too bad JB no longer sings these songs from the past. He doesn' look the same as in his videos... miss this Bieber.
maturing is realising people only hated this song and justin bieber because they wanted to get on the hate train.
To the 13 Million people who disliked this video- You think you are too cool for this song and therefore you think it' your job to hate it. Just know that it' not true. Sure it' super cheesy but it' classic and it' vibe.

(2 Corinthians 7:10) Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:7) For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)"

"Did anyone else beside me come check the dislikes, and then realize they are removed? :("
"Nearly 120 billion people have been born and died on this planet. Thousands of kings, rulers, shieks, pharohs, presidents, popes, have all ruled, and at some point or another released their grip on the civilizations they influenced and controlled, Due to mortality, war, change in cultures, natural disasters.... Revolutions. The 120ish billion people that have preceeded us all sought the same thing. To know our purpose and place in the universe. To live fulfilled and joyous lives, free from sickness and violence. To also know, by what hand the artist painted this creation on an infinite easal calls itself. What does it want with us? Does it care about us? We do not have to just sit and accept our disposition. We have to be strong and actually fight for what we believe in. We owe it to the entire planet to be told the whole truth behind our secret curtain called the Government and CIA, FBI. Donald Trump was literally recruiting for the Space Force. What more does the public want to awknoweledge UFO' as reality. We certainly enjoy the idea of them in movies invading us and triumphantly defeating them with George Lucas sized explosion. So why should the government be allowed to use, technological marvels thousands of years beyond our own with infinite potential? Because they do not just want to govern the laws and just be the institution that ensures programs are working correctly and the money goes to where it is needed. They want to rule the world. They want to tell you what kind of life you get to live. They want us to suffer. They are the most prominent. Evident. And capable evils on this planet hands down. And if you weren' aware, They ARE doing that right this second that you read this. And noone is trying to stop them. That is problem my friends. Please share this everywhere you can"
"The dislike button counter was removed, they were defeated."
"Who wants that YouTube should ban the MrBeast DP, Blue ✔ named account? He/She is very annoying 😫 Right? 1 like = 1 request."
